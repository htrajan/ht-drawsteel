### 7th-Level Features

As a 7th-level troubadour, you gain the following features.

#### Characteristic Increase

Each of your characteristic scores increases by 1, to a maximum of 4.

#### Equal Billing

You can use your Scene Partner feature to form a bond with one willing hero instead of an NPC you interact with using a test. If you bond with another hero, you lose your existing bond with a hero.

Additionally, you and creatures you are bonded with gain a +1 bonus to saving throws. Whenever you or a bonded creature succeeds on a saving throw, you and each creature you are bonded with gains temporary Stamina equal to your level.

#### A Muse's Muse

At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 + 1 drama instead of 1d3.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.
