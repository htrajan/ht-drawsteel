### 8th-Level Features

As an 8th-level troubadour, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one perk of your choice.

Your troubadour class act grants you a feature, as shown on the 8th-Level Class Act Features table.

###### 8th-Level Class Act Features Table

| Class Act | Feature         |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Auteur    | Deleted Scene   |
| Duelist   | Masterwork      |
| Virtuoso  | Crowd Favorites |

##### Crowd Favorites

You have the following performance abilities, which are usable with your Routines feature.

###### Moonlight Sonata

*Music pours out of your heart, filling the area with the utmost delicacy and without damper.*

| **Area, Magic, Performance** |                **No action** |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------: |
| **📏 5 aura**                | **🎯 Each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** While this performance is active, each target who is dead can choose to continue taking turns after death. On each of their turns, a target can move and use either a main action or a maneuver, but can't spend Recoveries or use triggered actions. At the end of the encounter, each target who chose to take turns this way turns to dust and blows away.

###### Radical Fantasia

*𝅘𝅥𝅮♪Viras, my Viras, will you hold their hands as they cryyy-aaaiigh?♪*

| **Area, Magic, Performance** |                         **No action** |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------: |
| **📏 5 aura**                | **🎯 Self and each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn in the area ignores difficult terrain, and any ability they use that imposes forced movement gains a +2 bonus to the forced movement distance until the end of their turn. Additionally, once per combat round, each target can use a triggered action as a free triggered action.

##### Deleted Scene

Whenever a creature within distance of your Dramatic Monologue ability makes a power roll, you can spend 1 drama as a free triggered action to use Dramatic Monologue, targeting only one creature.

##### Masterwork

Choose one of your signature abilities and name it after yourself. You always have this ability available, even if it is sourced from a kit you switch out. Whenever you use this ability, you gain an edge and 1 surge that you can use only on this ability.

Additionally, when your named signature ability is the last ability you use in an encounter, you can immediately use the Hear Ye, Hear Ye! effect of your Zeitgeist feature to tell tales of your exploits after the encounter ends.

#### 11-Drama Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 11 drama to use.

###### Dramatic Reveal (11 Drama)

*A little stage trickery, and where once stood a foe, now stands a friend!*

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter, whenever you reduce a creature to 0 Stamina using an ability, you can use a free triggered action to teleport an ally within distance of that ability into the creature's space in a plume of rose petals. You or the teleported ally can then make a melee free strike.

###### Power Ballad (11 Drama)
