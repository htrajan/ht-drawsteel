### 9th-Level Features

As a 9th-level tactician, you gain the following features.

#### Grandmaster of Arms

Your expertise with weapons has grown to true mastery. Whenever you use a signature ability from one of your equipped kits or make a free strike using a weapon from one of your equipped kits, you automatically obtain a tier 3 outcome on the power roll. You can still roll to determine if you score a critical hit.

#### 9th-Level Doctrine Ability

Your tactical doctrine grants your choice of one of two heroic abilities.

##### 9th-Level Insurgent Abilities

Choose one of the following abilities.

###### Squad! Hit and Run! (11 Focus)

*I had to pry this secret from the shadow colleges.*

| **Ranged**       |            **Main action** |
| ---------------- | -------------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 Self and two allies** |

**Effect:** Each target gains 2 surges, and can use a free triggered action to use a signature ability that gains an edge. After resolving their ability, each target can shift up to 2 squares and become hidden even if they have no cover or concealment, or if they are observed.

###### Their Lack of Focus Is Their Undoing (11 Focus)

*You trick your enemies into attacking each other and leave them confused by the aftermath.*

| **Magic, Ranged, Weapon** |      **Main action** |
| ------------------------- | -------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**          | **🎯 Three enemies** |

**Effect:** Each target uses a signature ability against one or more targets of your choosing, with each ability automatically obtaining a tier 3 outcome on the power roll. After resolving the targets' abilities, you make a power roll against each original target.

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** R < WEAK, dazed (save ends)
- **12-16:** R < AVERAGE, dazed (save ends)
- **17+:** R < STRONG, dazed (save ends)

##### 9th-Level Mastermind Abilities

| -------------- | ------------------------------------: |
| **📏 3 burst** | **🎯 Self and each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** Each target can make a ranged free strike that gains an edge against any enemy marked by you within distance of their ranged free strike. A target ignores banes and double banes when making this strike.

###### Counterstrategy (11 Focus)

*I've identified a way to negate their strengths.*

| **-**       | **Main action** |

###### That One Is Mine! (11 Focus)

*You focus on making an enemy irrelevant.*
