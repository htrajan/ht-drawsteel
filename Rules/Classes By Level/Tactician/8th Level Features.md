### 8th-Level Features

As an 8th-level tactician, you gain the following features.

###### 8th-Level Doctrine Features Table

| Doctrine   | Feature                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Insurgent  | Bait and Ambush                    |
| Mastermind | Pincer Movement                    |
| Vanguard   | See Your Enemies Driven Before You |

##### Bait and Ambush

You have trained your squad to be silent ambushers.

**Mark Benefit:** When you or any ally makes a strike against a creature marked by you, you can spend 2 focus to let the character making the strike shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score and use the Hide maneuver as a free maneuver once during the shift. The creature can shift before or after the strike is resolved.

##### Pincer Movement

You have trained your squad to coordinate their movements to maximize combat impact.

**Mark Benefit:** When you or any ally makes a strike against a creature marked by you, you can spend 2 focus to have the character making the strike shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score before the strike is resolved. If you didn't make the strike, you can make this shift as well. If you did make the strike, one ally within 10 squares of you can make this shift as well.

##### See Your Enemies Driven Before You

You have trained your squad to maximize impact and break enemy lines when they attack.

**Mark Benefit:** When you or any ally makes a melee strike against a creature marked by you, you can spend 2 focus to have the character making the strike push the target up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score. That character can then shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score, ending this shift adjacent to the target.

#### 11-Focus Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 11 focus to use.

###### Go Now and Speed Well (11 Focus)

*You direct an attack to strike true.*

| **Ranged**       |         **Main action** |
| ---------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** The target gains 2 surges and can use a signature or heroic ability as a free triggered action. The ability has a double edge on the power roll, ignores damage immunity, and increases the potency of any potency effects by 1.

###### Finish Them! (11 Focus)

*You point out an opening to your ally so they can land a killing blow.*

| **Ranged**       |  **Free triggered** |
| ---------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 One creature** |

**Trigger:** The target is not a leader or solo creature, and becomes winded.

**Effect:** The target is killed. Additionally, the creature who caused the target to be winded can spend a Recovery.

###### Floodgates Open (11 Focus)

*You direct your squad to strike in unison and with devastating effect.*

| **Ranged**       |     **Main action** |
| ---------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 Three allies** |

**Effect:** Each target gains 1 surge and can use a signature ability as a free triggered action. That ability gains an edge on the power roll and increases the potency of any potency effects by 1.

###### I'll Open and You'll Close (11 Focus)

*You create an opening for an ally.*

| **Melee, Ranged, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1 or ranged 5**        | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** 6 + M damage
- **12-16:** 10 + M damage
- **17+:** 14 + M damage

**Effect:** One ally within 10 squares of you can use a heroic ability against the target as a free triggered action without spending any of their Heroic Resource, as long as they have enough Heroic Resource to pay for the ability. If the target is reduced to 0 Stamina before the chosen ally has used their ability, the ally can pick a different target.
