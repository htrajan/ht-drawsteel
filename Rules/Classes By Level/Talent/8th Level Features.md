### 8th-Level Features

As an 8th-level talent, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one perk of your choice.

#### 8th-Level Tradition Features

Your talent tradition grants you two features, as shown on the 8th-Level Tradition Features table.

###### 8th-Level Tradition Features Table

| Tradition   | Features                          |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Chronopathy | Doubling the Hours, Stasis Shield |
| Telekinesis | Levitation Field, Low Gravity     |
| Telepathy   | Mindlink, Universal Connection    |

##### Doubling the Hours

While you have 5 or more Victories, you can undertake an additional respite activity during a respite.

##### Levitation Field

You have the following ability.

###### Levitation Field

*You manipulate the air around your allies so they can move as freely through the sky as you can.*

| **Area, Psionic** |                 **Maneuver** |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------: |
| **📏 3 burst**    | **🎯 Each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** Each target can fly until the start of your next turn, and can immediately shift up to their speed. You can also shift up to your speed. While flying, a target's stability is reduced to 0 and can't be increased.

**Spend 5 Clarity:** The effects last for 1 hour instead.

##### Low Gravity

Your mind can carry your body through tough times. You ignore difficult terrain and don't need to spend additional movement while prone.

##### Mindlink

During a respite, you can choose a number of creatures up to your Reason score who you have communicated with using your Telepathic Speech feature, creating a telepathic link among all of you. Whenever a linked creature spends one or more Recoveries, each other linked creature can spend a Recovery.

#### Stasis Shield

You have the following ability.

###### Stasis Shield (3 Clarity)

*You freeze time just long enough to bring the victim to safety!*

| **Psionic, Ranged** |                          **Triggered** |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**    | **🎯 Self, or one creature or object** |

**Trigger:** The target takes damage.

**Effect:** The target is teleported to an unoccupied space adjacent to you, taking no damage and suffering no additional effects if this movement would get them out of harm's way.

**Strained:** You can't target yourself, and you take the damage and any additional effects instead of the target.

#### Universal Connection

The range of your Telepathic Speech feature increases to anywhere on the same world.

#### 11-Clarity Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 11 clarity to use.

###### Doubt (11 Clarity)

*You tug at the strings of the foe's anima and unravel them, allowing someone else to take advantage of their drive.*

| **Animapathy, Psionic, Ranged**, **Strike** |               **Main action** |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                            | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** 10 + P damage; P < WEAK, weakened (save ends)
- **12-16:** 14 + P damage; P < AVERAGE, weakened (save ends)
- **17+:** 20 + P damage; P < STRONG, weakened and slowed (save ends)

**Effect:** This ability gains an edge against a target with a soul (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*). After you make the power roll, you or one ally within distance have a double edge on the next power roll you make before the end of the encounter.

**Strained:** You feel dispirited until you finish a respite. If you obtain a tier 3 outcome on the power roll, you and the target each have damage weakness 5 (save ends).

###### Mindwipe (11 Clarity)

*You attempt to make them forget all their training.*

| **Melee, Psionic, Strike, Telepathy** |     **Main action** |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 2**                        | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 12 + R damage; R < WEAK, the target takes a bane on their next power roll
- **12-16:** 17 + R damage; R < AVERAGE, the target takes a bane on power rolls (save ends)
- **17+:** 23 + R damage; R < STRONG, the target has a double bane on power rolls (save ends)

**Effect:** The target can't communicate with anyone until the end of the encounter.

**Strained:** You take 3d6 damage.

###### Rejuvenate (11 Clarity)

*You reshape the flow of time in the target's body to return it to an earlier state.*

| **Chronopathy, Psionic, Ranged** |            **Maneuver** |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                 | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** Choose two of the following effects:

- The target can spend any number of Recoveries.
- The target gains 1 of their Heroic Resource, and can end any effects on them that are ended by a saving throw or that end at the end of their turn.
- The target gains 2 surges, and gains a +3 bonus to speed until the end of the encounter.

**Strained:** You and the target both permanently grow visibly younger (the equivalent of 20 human years, to the minimum of an 18-year-old). Additionally, you are weakened and slowed (save ends).

###### Steel (11 Clarity)

*The target's skin becomes covered in tough metal.*

| **Metamorphosis, Psionic, Ranged** |            **Maneuver** |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                   | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** The target has damage immunity 5 and can't be made slowed or weakened until the start of your next turn. Whenever the target force moves a creature or object while under this effect, the forced movement distance gains a +5 bonus.

**Strained:** You can't use maneuvers (save ends).
