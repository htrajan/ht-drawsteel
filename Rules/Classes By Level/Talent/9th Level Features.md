#### 9th-Level Tradition Ability

Your talent tradition grants your choice of one of two heroic abilities.

##### 9th-Level Chronopathy Abilities

Choose one of the following abilities.

###### Acceleration Field (11 Clarity)

*You forcibly stuff more moments into a critical point in time, knowing full well you might need to steal some of your own.*

| **Chronopathy, Psionic, Ranged** |     **Main action** |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 5**                  | **🎯 Three allies** |

**Effect:** Each target can use any main action available to them as a free triggered action, but they lose their main action on their next turn.

**Strained:** Make a power roll that targets you and each enemy within distance.

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** 4 corruption damage; slowed (save ends)
- **12-16:** 6 corruption damage; slowed (save ends)
- **17+:** 10 corruption damage; slowed (save ends)

###### Borrow From the Future (11 Clarity)

| **Area, Chronopathy, Psionic** |                 **Maneuver** |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------: |
| **📏 2 burst**                 | **🎯 Each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** The targets share 6 of their Heroic Resource among themselves, as you determine. A target can't gain more than 3 of their Heroic Resource this way. After using this ability, you can't gain any clarity until the end of the next combat round.

| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------: |
| **📏 Special**                 | **🎯 Each enemy and object in the area** |

**Effect:** Make a power roll to determine the area of this ability. Each target is vertical pushed 6 squares. You can target only objects of size 1L or smaller.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

###### Gravitic Nova (11 Clarity)

*Unbridled psionic energy erupts from your body and flashes outward, hurling your foes back.*

| **Area, Psionic, Telekinesis** |                          **Main action** |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------: |
| **📏 3 burst**                 | **🎯 Each enemy and object in the area** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 6 damage; push 7
- **12-16:** 9 damage; push 10
- **17+:** 13 damage; push 15

**Effect:** On a critical hit, the size of the area increases by 3, and this ability deals an extra 10 damage.

###### Resonant Mind Spike (11 Clarity)

*You fire a telepathic bolt empowered by every consciousness within reach directly into your foe's mind.*

| -------------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                       | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 15 + R psychic damage
- **12-16:** 24 + R psychic damage
- **17+:** 28 + R psychic damage

**Effect:** This ability ignores cover and concealment.

**Strained:** The ability roll scores a critical hit on a natural 17 or higher. You take half the damage the target takes, and you can't reduce this damage in any way.

###### Synaptic Terror (11 Clarity)

*You project a terrifying image into the brains of your foes, and their fear psionically invigorates your allies.*

| **Area, Psionic, Telepathy** |                        **Main action** |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------: |
| **📏 3 burst**               | **🎯 Each ally and enemy in the area** |

**Effect:** You and each target ally can't obtain lower than a tier 2 outcome on power rolls until the start of your next turn. Each target enemy is affected by the ability's power roll.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** R < WEAK, frightened (save ends)
- **12-16:** R < AVERAGE, frightened (save ends)
- **17+:** R < STRONG, frightened (save ends)

**Strained:** You can't use this ability if doing so would cause you to have negative clarity.
