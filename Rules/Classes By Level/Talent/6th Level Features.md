### 6th-Level Features

As a 6th-level talent, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one interpersonal, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice.

#### Psi Boost

Whenever you use an ability that is a main action or a maneuver with the Psionic keyword, you can spend additional discipline to apply a psi boost to it and enhance its effects. A psi boost's effects only last until the end of the turn which the ability is first used. You can apply multiple psi boosts to an ability, but only one instance of each specific boost. You can use the following psi boosts.

##### Dynamic Power (1 Clarity)

If the ability force moves a target, the forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to your Reason score.

##### Expanded Power (3 Clarity)

If the ability targets an area, you increase the size of the area by 1. If the area is a line, you increase the size of one dimension, not both.

##### Extended Power (1 Clarity)

If the ability is ranged, the distance gains a bonus equal to your Reason score. If the ability is melee, the distance gains a +2 bonus.

##### Heightened Power (1 Clarity)

If the ability deals rolled damage, it deals extra damage equal to your Reason score.

##### Magnified Power (5 Clarity)

If the ability has a potency, you increase that potency by an amount equal to your Reason score.

##### Shared Power (5 Clarity)

If the ability targets individual creatures or objects, you target one additional creature or object within distance.

##### Sharpened Power (1 Clarity)

If the ability has any power roll, that roll gains an edge.

#### 6th-Level Tradition Ability

Your talent tradition grants your choice of one of two heroic abilities.

##### 6th-Level Chronopathy Abilities

Choose one of the following abilities.

###### Fate (9 Clarity)

*Your foe gets a glimpse of how it will end for them.*

| **📏 Melee 2**                  | **🎯 One enemy** |

**Effect:** The target has damage weakness 5 until the end of your next turn. Whenever the target takes damage while they have this weakness, they are knocked prone.

| **📏 4 cube within 10**                | **🎯 Each creature and object in the area** |

**Effect:** The area is frozen in time until the start of your next turn. Each object in the area is restrained and can't fall until the effect ends. Until the effect ends, creatures in the area who are reduced to 0 Stamina or would die stay alive, and objects in the area that are reduced to 0 Stamina remain undestroyed.

Make a power roll that targets each enemy in the area.

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** P < WEAK, the target is slowed until the effect ends
- **12-16:** P < AVERAGE, the target's speed is 0 until the effect ends
- **17+:** P < STRONG, the target is restrained until the effect ends

**Strained:** Any creature or object force moved in the area takes 2 corruption damage for each square of the area they enter. Creatures and objects restrained in the area can be force moved. You are restrained until the effect ends.

- **12-16:** Slide 8 + R; M < AVERAGE, the forced movement is vertical
- **17+:** Slide 12 + R; prone; M < STRONG, the forced movement is vertical

**Strained:** The forced movement ignores stability. You take 2d6 damage and are weakened (save ends).

#### 6th-Level Telepathy Abilities

###### Synaptic Conditioning (9 Clarity)
