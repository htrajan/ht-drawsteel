###### 3rd-Level Elemental Specialization Features Table

| Specialization | Feature                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Earth          | Earth Accepts Me                 |
| Fire           | A Conversation With Fire         |
| Green          | Remember Growth and Sun and Rain |
| Void           | Distance Is Only Memory          |

##### A Conversation With Fire

When you spend 1 uninterrupted minute in front of a fire, you can speak the name of another creature. If that creature is willing to speak to you, their image appears in the fire, and they can see you before them in a shimmering ball of light. The two of you can speak to each other through these images as if you were together in person. As a maneuver, you or the creature can end the conversation.

##### Distance Is Only Memory

Each time you finish a respite, you can open a two-way portal that leads to any place you have previously been. You and your allies can pass through the portal, which remains open for 1 hour or until you dismiss it as a main action.

##### Earth Accepts Me

You have the following ability.

###### Earth Accepts Me

*You can slip into the stone.*

| **Earth, Magic** | **Main action** |
| ---------------- | --------------: |
| **📏 Self**      |     **🎯 Self** |

**Effect:** You step into a mundane dirt, metal, or stone object (including a wall) that is as large as you or larger. You can remain inside the object for as long as you like. While inside the object, you can observe events and speak to creatures outside it, but you don't have line of effect to anything outside the object and vice versa. You can travel through the object freely until you exit it. If the object you meld with is destroyed, you take 10 damage and exit the object.

##### Remember Growth and Sun and Rain

You have the following ability.

###### Remember Growth and Sun and Rain

*You stir any wood's memory and learn what it has seen.*

| **Green, Magic, Melee** |                  **Main action** |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**          | **🎯 One mundane wooden object** |

**Effect:** You see and hear any events that have occurred within 10 squares of the object within the last 12 hours, perceiving those events from the object's location as if you were there.

#### 7-Essence Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 7 essence to use.

###### Erase (7 Essence)

*With a flick of the wrist, you phase creatures out of existence.*

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **12-16:** Two creatures
- **17+:** Three creatures

**Effect:** Each target begins to fade from existence (save ends). On their first turn while fading from existence, a target takes a bane on power rolls. At the end of their first turn, they have a double bane on power rolls. At the end of their second turn, they fade from existence for 1 hour, after which they reappear in their original space or the nearest unoccupied space.

###### Wall of Fire (7 Essence)

*A blazing, beautifully organized inferno erupts at your command.*

| **Area, Fire, Magic, Ranged** |   **Maneuver** |
| ----------------------------- | -------------: |
| **📏 10 wall within 10**      | **🎯 Special** |

**Effect:** The wall lasts until the start of your next turn, and can be placed in occupied squares. Creatures can enter and pass through the wall. Each enemy who enters the area for the first time in a combat round or starts their turn there takes fire damage equal to your Reason score for each square of the area they start their turn in or enter.

**Persistent 1:** The wall lasts until the start of your next turn, and you can add a number of squares to the wall equal to your Reason score.
