As a 5th-level conduit, you gain the following features.

#### 5th-Level Domain Feature

You gain the 4th-level domain feature for the domain whose feature you didn't select at that level (see 4th-Level Domain Feature).

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 9 piety to use.
