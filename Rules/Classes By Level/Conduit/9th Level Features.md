### 9th-Level Features

As a 9th-level conduit, you gain the following features.

#### Faith's Sword

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose a willing hero ally who finished the respite with you. That ally gains the benefits of your Burgeoning Saint feature until you finish another respite. Additionally, you can spend piety as a free maneuver to give the hero 1 of their Heroic Resource for every 2 piety spent.

#### Ordained

Your god elevates the power flowing through you. Your characteristic scores are treated as 1 higher for the purpose of resisting potencies. Additionally, while you have 5 or more Victories, you speak with the voice of your deity. You have a double edge on Presence tests made to influence other creatures.

#### 9th-Level Domain Ability

Choose one of your domains. You gain a heroic ability from that domain, as shown on the 9th-Level Conduit Domain Abilities table.
