### 3rd-Level Features

As a 3rd-level censor, you gain the following features.

#### Look On My Work and Despair

Your judgment has grown in divine power, instilling fear in those you condemn. Whenever you use your Judgment ability, you can spend 1 wrath, and if the target has P < AVERAGE, they are frightened of you (save ends). Additionally, whenever a creature judged by you is reduced to 0 Stamina and you use Judgment as a free triggered action, if the new target has P < STRONG, they are frightened of you (save ends). If the target is already frightened of you, they instead take holy damage equal to twice your Presence score.

#### 7-Wrath Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 7 wrath to use.

###### Edict of Disruptive Isolation (7 Wrath)

*The evil within your foes detonates with holy fire that burns only the guilty.*

| **Area, Magic** |                  **Maneuver** |
| --------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 2 aura**   | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or until you are dying, each target takes holy damage equal to your Presence score at the end of each of your turns. A target takes an extra 2d6 holy damage if they are judged by you or if they are adjacent to any enemy.

###### Edict of Perfect Order (7 Wrath)

*Within the area of your divine presence, your enemies will regret using their fell abilities.*

| **Area, Magic** |                  **Maneuver** |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or until you are dying, whenever a target uses an ability that costs Malice (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*), they take holy damage equal to three times your Presence score. A target judged by you takes an extra 2d6 holy damage.

###### Edict of Purifying Pacifism (7 Wrath)

*You shed a righteous energy that punishes enemies who would harm you or your allies.*

| **Area, Magic** |                  **Maneuver** |
| --------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 2 aura**   | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or until you are dying, whenever a target makes a strike, they take holy damage equal to twice your Presence score. A target judged by you takes an extra 2d6 holy damage.

###### Edict of Stillness (7 Wrath)

*The holy aura you project makes it painful for evil-doers to leave your reach.*

| **Area, Magic** |                  **Maneuver** |
| --------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 2 aura**   | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or until you are dying, whenever a target moves or is force moved out of the area, they take holy damage equal to twice your Presence score. A target judged by you who moves willingly takes an extra 2d6 holy damage.
