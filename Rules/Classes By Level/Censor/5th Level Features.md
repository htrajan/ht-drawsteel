### 5th-Level Features

As a 5th-level censor, you gain the following features.

#### 5th-Level Order Feature

Your censor order grants you a feature, as shown on the 5th-Level Order Features table.

###### 5th-Level Order Features Table

| Order    | Feature       |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Exorcist | Evil Revealed |
| Oracle   | Prophecy      |
| Paragon  | Stand Fast!   |

##### Evil Revealed

Your order has taught you methods to discern the disguises of both mortals and monsters. You automatically see through disguises and illusions created by creatures of your level or lower, and you gain an edge on tests made to see through the disguises and illusions of more powerful creatures. Whenever you see through a creature's disguise or illusion, you can use your Judgment ability against them as a free triggered action.

##### Prophecy

You can better sift through the constant fragmentary visions from your deity and act to make them manifest. Each time you earn 1 or more Victories, you can make a number of 2d10 rolls equal to the number of Victories you earned. Record each roll in order. Then whenever you or a creature within 10 squares makes a power roll, you can use a free triggered action to replace the total on the dice with your first recorded roll.

You discard each roll as it is used, and each time you earn Victories, you add new rolls to the bottom of the list. Any unused rolls are discarded when you finish a respite.

##### Stand Fast!

Your divine spark grows in power, allowing you and your allies to focus and endure. At the start of each of your turns, you can spend 1d6 Stamina to end one effect on you that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of your turn. Any ally who starts their turn within 5 squares of you can also spend Stamina to gain this benefit.

#### 9-Wrath Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 9 wrath to use.
