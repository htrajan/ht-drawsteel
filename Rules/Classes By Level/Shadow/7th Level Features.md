### 7th-Level Features

As a 7th-level shadow, you gain the following features.

#### Characteristic Increase

Each of your characteristic scores increases by 1, to a maximum of 4.

#### Keen Insight

At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 + 1 insight instead of 1d3.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.

#### Careful Observation Improvement

You can target two creatures simultaneously with your Careful Observation ability, observing both simultaneously. Making a strike against one target doesn't end your observation of the other target.

#### Ventriloquist

Whenever you communicate, you can throw your voice so that it seems to originate from a creature or object within 10 squares. If you are hidden, talking this way doesn't cause you to be revealed.
