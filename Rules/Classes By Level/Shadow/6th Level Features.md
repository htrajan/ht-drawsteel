### 6th-Level Features

As a 6th-level shadow, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one perk of your choice.

#### Umbral Form

As a maneuver, you lose control of yourself, becoming a shadow creature dripping with ash. This transformation lasts until the end of the encounter, until you are dying, or after 1 uninterrupted hour of quiet focus outside of combat. You gain the following effects while in this form:

- You can automatically climb at full speed while moving.

- If you end your turn with cover or concealment from another creature, you are automatically hidden from that creature.
- You gain 1 surge at the start of each of your turns.
- You have corruption immunity equal to 5 + your level.
