### 2nd-Level Features

As a 2nd-level shadow, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one exploration, interpersonal, or intrigue perk of your choice. See Chapter 7: Perks.

#### 2nd-Level College Feature

Your shadow college grants you a feature, as shown on the 2nd-Level College Features table.

###### 2nd-Level College Features Table

| College         | Feature          |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Black Ash       | Burning Ash      |
| Caustic Alchemy | Trained Assassin |
| Harlequin Mask  | Friend!          |

##### Burning Ash

The ash you leave behind burns your foes. The first time on a turn that you use a shadow ability to teleport away from or into a space adjacent to an enemy, that enemy takes fire damage equal to your Agility score.

##### Friend!

Your illusions make your enemies believe you are their friend in critical moments. Whenever an enemy uses an ability or trait that targets multiple allies and you are within distance of the effect, you can choose to be a target of the effect as well.

Additionally, when you use your I'm No Threat ability, you can take the Disengage move action as part of that ability.

##### Trained Assassin

You know just where to cut your enemies. Whenever you make a strike that has no bane or double bane, and that incorporates 1 or more surges, you gain 1 additional surge that you can use only on that strike.

#### 2nd-Level College Ability

Your shadow college grants your choice of one of two heroic abilities.

**Effect:** You attach a small bomb to a creature. If you are hidden from the creature, they don't notice the bomb and you remain hidden. The creature otherwise notices the bomb and can disarm and remove it as a main action. If they don't, at the end of your next turn, the bomb detonates. When the bomb detonates, you make a power roll targeting each enemy within 2 squares of it.
