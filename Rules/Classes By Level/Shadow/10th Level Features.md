### 10th-Level Features

As a 10th-level shadow, you gain the following features.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Agility score increases to 5. Additionally, you can increase one of your characteristic scores by 1, to a maximum of 5.

#### Death Pool

The first time each combat round that you deal damage incorporating 1 or more surges, you gain 3 insight instead of 2.

#### Perk

You gain one perk of your choice.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.

#### Careful Observation Improvement

You can target three creatures simultaneously with your Careful Observation ability.

#### Improved Umbral Form

You gain full control over the shadow creature you become with your Umbral Form feature, and you can end the transformation at will (no action required). Additionally, you are always wreathed in darkness that grants you concealment while in this form, and creatures no longer gain an edge on strikes against you.

While you are in your umbral form, you can spend 1 uninterrupted minute concentrating on a location where you've been before. At the end of that minute, you and each willing creature of your choice within 10 squares of you can teleport to unoccupied spaces of your choice within that location. Each creature who teleports this way is invisible for 1 hour or until they use an ability.

#### Subterfuge

You have an epic resource called subterfuge. Each time you finish a respite, you gain subterfuge equal to the XP you gain. You can spend subterfuge on your abilities as if it were insight.

Additionally, you can spend subterfuge to take additional maneuvers on your turn. You can use one maneuver for each subterfuge you spend.

Subterfuge remains until you spend it.
