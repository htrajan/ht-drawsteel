### 7th-Level Features

As a 7th-level fury, you gain the following features.

#### Characteristic Increase

Each of your characteristic scores increases by 1, to a maximum of 4.

#### Elemental Form

You exhibit ever-stronger signs of how the force of the Primordial Chaos flows within you. Whenever you show strong emotion or increase your ferocity, elemental motes attuned to your mood flit around you, and your skin changes in appearance to reflect an element of your choice.

Additionally, if you are a berserker or reaver, you have immunity to acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, and sonic damage equal to your Might score. If you are a stormwight, you have immunity to the damage type of your Primordial Storm feature equal to twice your Might score.

#### Greater Ferocity

When you gain ferocity at the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 + 1 ferocity instead of 1d3.

#### Growing Ferocity Improvement

Your Growing Ferocity feature provides additional benefits when you have 10 or more ferocity.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.
