#### Theoretical Warrior

*I've read about this tactic in books—it looks fairly straightforward.*

**Prerequisite:** You have the Master Librarian title, and you complete a Learn From a Master project with a project goal of 1,000.

**Effect:** Your choice of your Reason or Intuition increases by 1 (to a maximum of 6).

Additionally, choose a heroic ability belonging to any class. You gain this heroic ability, which can be paid for using the Heroic Resource of your class. You can't use a heroic ability that requires a class feature you don't have.
