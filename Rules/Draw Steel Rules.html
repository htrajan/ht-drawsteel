  <section id="what-is-this-game" class="level2">
    <h2>WHAT IS THIS GAME?</h2>
    <p>This is a game about fighting monsters. About
    larger-than-life, extraordinary heroes plunging into battle
    against terrifying, monstrous enemies.</p>
    <p>That covers a lot! So let's get specific and talk about what
    this game is, and what it is not.</p>
    <p>This game will absolutely feature dungeons. Ancient
    underground complexes filled with ravenous undead or creeping
    oozes. But it isn't a dungeon crawler. It's not about “clearing
    rooms.” It's not a survival horror game where you must track
    light and food and the weight of every object you carry.</p>
    <p>You can fight monsters in a dungeon, but the game is not
    about dungeons. Lots of games focus on that gameplay and do it
    really well! Like Shadowdark.</p>
    <p>It's not a wilderness exploration game, aka a hex crawl.
    It's not about surviving in extreme weather, getting lost, or
    trying to navigate your way back to safety.</p>
    <p>You can fight monsters in the wilderness, even run a whole
    campaign in the wilderness, but this game is not about the
    wilderness. We love games that focus on that fantasy, like
    <em>Forbidden Lands</em>.</p>
    <p>You can run adventures with horror themes, but this is not a
    horror roleplaying game like <em>Call of Cthulhu</em>. Your
    sessions can and will feature comedy, but this isn't a comedy
    RPG like <em>Paranoia</em>.</p>
    <p>We genuinely love all those games. But we love them because
    they focus on specific genres of gameplay and deliver on them
    really well.</p>
    <p>Our game is heroic fantasy. That's its genre. Extraordinary
    people fighting dragons and necromancers.</p>
    <p>But “heroic fantasy” is still a little too broad for our
    purposes, so we added two other keywords to explain how our
    game might be different from other games in this genre:
    tactical and cinematic.</p>
    <p>These terms are just guidelines. A vibe. But we find them
    useful when trying to choose between different features. “Both
    of these ideas are cool, but which is the most cinematic? The
    most heroic?”</p>
    <p>So let's talk about what we mean when we use these
    terms.</p>
    <section id="tactical" class="level3">
      <h3>TACTICAL</h3>
      <p>Strategy is: “What are we trying to do?” Break a siege,
      free a prisoner, rescue a captive, steal a tome of ancient
      lore. Strategy is about long-term goals.</p>
      <p>Tactics is about: “How are we going to do that?” We're
      going to … surround them! Sneak around them! Pick them off
      one by one! Kill their leader first. Kill their priest first!
      “No resurrections!”</p>
      <p>In a tactical game, positioning matters. So our game is
      played on a grid. Effects and distances are measured in
      squares. This means everyone is looking at the same problem,
      and there is no ambiguity regarding where the heroes and
      villains are in relation to each other. The hobgoblin
      troopers are setting themselves up in a line to stop our
      tactician and fury from getting into melee with the hobgoblin
      war mage. We can all see that happening, and can talk about
      what we're going to do to stop it.</p>
      <p>That means teamwork matters. That's why initiative works
      the way it does—to encourage the players to plan! “Okay, you
      use Concussive Slam on that trooper, it'll push him back, and
      on my turn I can use Phalanx Forward to get us all into melee
      with the death captain.”</p>
      <p>We think focusing on teamwork also makes the game more
      heroic! :D</p>
      <p>In a tactical game, you have many choices each round. You
      are never reduced to just swinging your sword. You have
      options. If we do a good job, you don't feel like you
      outlasted your opponents because you wore their hit points
      down before they could reduce yours to 0—you feel like you
      beat those hobgoblins! Through stealth and sorcery,
      coordination and ferocity!</p>
      <p>As you play with the same group of characters, you learn
      what they can all do. You discover synergies, “combos.” Some
      of them intended by the designers, some not! You start to
      learn these unique characters, and rely on them to do their
      cool things. It's a great feeling when another player comes
      up with a cool plan that relies on your unique abilities.</p>
      <p>You learn which characters are the “squishies” who need to
      be protected or healed. You learn which characters can push
      themselves right to the edge and keep fighting. “Don't worry
      about healing Barlaca. She's our fury. She's happier with 3
      Stamina.”</p>
      <p>Our game is not about tactics. It's not a war game. But it
      is tactical.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="heroic" class="level3">
      <h3>HEROIC</h3>
      <p>Our game is definitely about heroism! :D</p>
      <p>For us, this means a couple of things. It means we don't
      assume your character is primarily motivated by greed. They
      might be! But we don't assume that. Instead we assume you're
      going to do the right thing. It might take some convincing,
      and there might be some reluctant heroes in your party, but
      that's part of the fun!</p>
      <p>You should absolutely be able to run a <em>Chain of
      Acheron</em>-style campaign where the heroes are hard-bitten
      mercenaries in a morally ambiguous world. But that's not the
      baseline assumption. The fiction and adventures that inspire
      us feature epic villains trying to remake the world in their
      image, and the dashing, unyielding heroes who strive against
      them even in the face of impossible odds.</p>
      <p>So that's one component of the heroic keyword. But another
      component, equally important, is what kinds of things happen
      “on-screen,” so to speak. This is very closely related to the
      cinematic keyword.</p>
      <p>For instance, you never see Indiana Jones having to find a
      local sporting goods store because he needs to stock up on
      ammo. You never see Katniss Everdeen have to stop and take a
      shower because she stinks.</p>
      <p>These things do happen. No one watching <em>Raiders of the
      Lost Ark</em> thinks that Indy's gun is magical and doesn't
      need bullets—but we just don't need to see Indy doing that
      stuff. We don't need to waste time on it.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="cinematic" class="level3">
      <h3>CINEMATIC</h3>
      <p>Closely tied to the heroic keyword, the cinematic keyword
      is about how we like powers and abilities with a strong
      visual component. You can imagine your character doing or
      saying these things. “In All This Confusion” is a good name
      for the shadow's ability to slip out of melee and retreat to
      safety. The text of the ability says how it works, but the
      name creates a visual that explains how it's working.</p>
      <p>When Sir Vanazor the dragon knight fury leaps onto a
      goblin war spider, cleaving through the goblins riding the
      creature in a single turn, you can see it in your mind. It
      feels like a movie. It doesn't feel simply as if you rolled
      well, but like an epic scene, complete with slow motion and a
      Carpenter Brut soundtrack.</p>
      <p>You should imagine your tactician character leading the
      battle, granting your allies free attacks, extra maneuvers.
      Coordinating the battle. That's what the name implies. And if
      we've done a good job, when you read the character's
      abilities, you think, “Yes! This is what I was imagining! I
      can't wait to do this!”</p>
    </section>
    <section id="fantasy" class="level3">
      <h3>FANTASY</h3>
      <p>Just … you know … it's got dragons and stuff. :D</p>
      <p>It's worth mentioning—while everyone basically already
      knows what fantasy means in this context, we do imagine it a
      little more broadly than your average classical medieval
      fantasy. We like that stuff! Vasloria is our medieval
      European fantasy analog with knights on horseback and wizards
      in towers. But we also like high fantasy urban intrigue, and
      so we're developing Capital, the City of the Great Game, the
      Greatest City In This or Any Age. Vasloria is mostly humans
      and elves and orcs and dwarves, but Capital has dozens,
      hundreds of different ancestries in it.</p>
      <p>Looking back at movies like Star Wars and the work of
      artists like Chris Foss, that '70s stuff now seems explicitly
      fantastical. There's nothing scientific or even plausible
      about a lightsaber or a John Berkey spaceship. But damn, they
      look cool!</p>
      <p>So our setting includes the timescape—our multiverse, of
      which the world of Orden containing Capital and Vasloria is
      only one part. The timescape is more explicitly “space
      fantasy.”</p>
      <p>These core rules mostly cover the classic fantasy stuff.
      But we think Capital and the timescape will help us deliver a
      game where more people can see their fantasy in our
      worlds.</p>
      <p>For us, fantasy includes magic, like wizards casting
      spells, and psionics, the natural and focused ability some
      creatures have to manipulate and warp reality with their
      minds. You know, telekinesis and telepathy! Jean Grey style!
      Although heroes have a few of these options in the core
      rules, you'll see more psionics in later products.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="if-youre-coming-from-d20-fantasy" class="level3">
      <h3>IF YOU'RE COMING FROM D20 FANTASY…</h3>
      <p>If you've most often played medieval fantasy RPGs that use
      a d20 and have Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
      Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as primary creature
      statistics, you're going to notice a lot of similarities
      between that style of game and Draw Steel. But as talked
      about above, our game is explicitly heroic and tactical, and
      it includes our own ideas of what a fantasy world should
      include. As such, you'll definitely notice some differences.
      We might use similar terminology for rules, but our use of
      those game terms might mean different things, because we're
      trying to support a specific style of play and there are only
      so many words that make sense to use with a fantasy game in
      the English language.</p>
      <p>Here are a few key distinctions between this game and
      typical d20 fantasy that you'll notice right away. These
      aren't the only distinctions, but they're the most
      obvious:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Attacks automatically deal damage.</strong> You
        can still have a bad turn! A tier one result is not
        awesome, but at least you're making progress. The trick is:
        who's making progress faster? You or the monsters? Since
        there's no “I miss, next” in this game, fights tend to be
        short. 5 rounds is a long fight. Because everyone's always
        doing damage!</li>
        <li><strong>You don't need to rest all the time.</strong>
        Most d20 fantasy games are games of attrition. Your spell
        slots and other features dwindle as the adventuring day
        goes on. In Draw Steel, you need to rest to regain your
        Stamina and Recoveries (the stat that determine how robust
        you are in combat). But all characters earn the ability to
        use their magic and other awesome abilities as they
        adventure, encouraging you to press on heroically.</li>
        <li><strong>Character options are different.</strong> We
        very strongly recommend you start by looking through the
        character creation section before you decide what you want
        to play. You can't just assume the conduit is “basically a
        cleric.” In some ways it is! But in other ways it's very
        different. You may have some cool character archetype you
        love to play in d20 Fantasy and you're dying to see how it
        works in <em>Draw Steel</em>, but you'll have a lot more
        fun if you start by browsing the Ancestries and Class
        sections and being inspired. Once you know how the game
        works, you'll have a better handle on how to build your
        favorite character in here.</li>
        <li><strong>Smaller bonuses and penalties</strong> <em>Draw
        Steel</em> is built around the roll of two ten-sided dice
        to produce three possible outcomes. On the surface, this
        might not seem that different from rolling a twenty-sided
        die and having two outcomes, but we've run the math. A lot.
        A bonus of +1 or penalty of −2 is significant in <em>Draw
        Steel</em>, much more so than in a typical d20 fantasy
        game. That means you should feel pretty good attempting
        most power rolls—the rolls you make to determine success
        out of combat—if you have a decent characteristic bonus on
        those rolls. And if you have a specific skill that applies
        to a power roll made as a test outside of combat, you'll do
        even better.</li>
        <li><strong>Our game has a lot of skills</strong> Your
        character can make use of a long list of skills, but we
        don't expect you to memorize that list. We get into why
        there are so many skills in the <em>Tests</em> chapter, but
        the short version is that we think having a lot of skills
        allows you to create more distinct and specialized heroes,
        which supports the sort of gameplay we want to see in
        <em>Draw Steel</em>. And skills in <em>Draw Steel</em>
        aren't tied to characteristics. If you're trying to lose
        someone in a crowd? You can use Presence to Hide! Why
        not?</li>
        <li><strong>We won't be able to point out every
        difference.</strong> Beyond what's noted here, don't assume
        that these rules work like any d20 fantasy game you've
        played. We don't have the space to point out every
        exception. So if you're in doubt about how something works,
        put d20 fantasy out of your mind and read our rules without
        those assumptions, and you'll find that things make better
        sense. If you're still confused, stop by the MCDM Discord
        and ask. We've got tons of awesome community members ready
        to help!</li>
        <li><strong>We don't expect you to do everything to the
        letter.</strong> This is actually one thing <em>Draw
        Steel</em> does have in common with d20 fantasy. This is a
        big book of rules! Don't stress if you need to look
        something up or make a ruling about an edge case on the
        fly. If everyone's having fun, you're doing it right.</li>

  <section id="the-basics" class="level2">
    <h2>THE BASICS</h2>
    <p>The flow of playing Draw Steel is like playing any other
    tabletop roleplaying game with a Director (also called a Game
    Master or GM in other games). Play is a conversation between
    the Director and the heroes that describes the story. The
    Director sets the scene, describing the important elements of
    the environment that the heroes would notice.</p>
    <p><strong>Director</strong>: You stand in the doorway of the
    top level of the ruined necromancer's tower. The air is stale
    and reeks of death. A pale full moon shines through a broken
    ceiling, illuminating six sarcophagi upon a raised dais, each
    with a lid carved in the likeness of a devil. Broken flasks,
    beakers, and other laboratory glass covers the floor.</p>
    <p>After the Director sets the scene, each player describes how
    their character interacts with the area. The Director then
    describes how the environment and any creatures in it respond
    to the heroes' actions.</p>
    <p><strong>Alyssa (playing Jorn)</strong>: I'm going to hang
    out at the back of the group with my warhammer drawn. I want to
    be ready in case any of those skeletons we snuck by on the
    lower levels make their way up the stairs.</p>
    <p><strong>Matt (playing Linn)</strong>: Linn uses her
    Telekinesis ability to sweep up the glass on the floor and form
    a path free of glass that goes from the door to the dais.</p>
    <p><strong>James (playing Korvo)</strong>: I'll light a torch
    as I step into the room. Is there anything new we can see
    now?</p>
    <p><strong>Director</strong>: With the glass cleared away and
    brighter light glowing in the room, you can see that the floor
    is covered in faded sigils.</p>
    <p>At some point, a player will have their hero attempt a task
    that has a risk of failing in a way that is narratively
    interesting. In such cases, the Director calls for some dice to
    be rolled! Don't worry—the rules outline when and how to do
    this.</p>
    <p><strong>Grace (playing Val)</strong>: Before anyone steps on
    them, I want to examine the symbols and figure out what they
    mean.</p>
    <p><strong>Director</strong>: Okay, well for that, I need you
    to make an easy Reason test.</p>
    <p><strong>Grace</strong>: I got a 12! What do I know?</p>
    <p><strong>Director</strong>: You can tell these old sigils are
    part of a necromancy spell that has been woven into the stone
    floor. Also, Jorn can hear something coming up the steps. It's
    the clicking and clacking of bone on stone.</p>
    <p><strong>Alyssa</strong>: Uh, let's make a decision here,
    folks. We got boneheads incoming!</p>
    <p><strong>Matt</strong>: Linn has had enough of this
    dillydallying. She moves to the dais and ushers everyone inside
    the room so we can shut and barricade the door.</p>
    <p><strong>Grace</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
    <p><strong>Director</strong>: Before anyone else can move,
    Linn's foot connects with one of the sigils. A burst of red
    lightning cracks from the place where her foot touched the
    floor, running to the walls and up to the ceiling.</p>
    <p><strong>Matt</strong>: Oh, right. Necromancy.</p>
    <p><strong>Grace</strong>: Yeah. Should have warned you.</p>
    <p><strong>Director</strong>: The whole tower starts to sway as
    the sarcophagus lids slide to the floor and clawed undead hands
    emerge from within. Six decaying devils, each tattooed with
    glowing green runes, rise. They're eager for violence.</p>
    <p><strong>James</strong>: I think we found the Rotting Lords
    of Hell.</p>
    <p><strong>Director</strong>: Draw steel!</p>

      <h3>CHARACTERISTICS</h3>
      <p>Each creature in the game has five characteristics that
      represent their capacity to interact with other creatures and
      the environment.</p>
      <section id="might" class="level4">
        <h4>MIGHT</h4>
        <p>Might (MGT) represents strength and brawn. A creature's
        ability to break down doors, swing an axe, stand up during
        an earthquake, or hurl an ally across a chasm is determined
        by Might.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="agility" class="level4">
        <h4>AGILITY</h4>
        <p>Agility (AGL) represents coordination and nimbleness. A
        creature's ability to backflip out of danger, shoot a
        crossbow, dodge an explosion, or pluck keys from a guard's
        belt is determined by Agility.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="reason" class="level4">
        <h4>REASON</h4>
        <p>Reason (REA) represents a logical mind and education. A
        creature's ability to solve a puzzle that unlocks a door,
        recall lore about necromancy, decipher a coded message, or
        blast a foe with psionic power is determined by Reason.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="intuition" class="level4">
        <h4>INTUITION</h4>
        <p>Intuition (INU) represents instincts and experience. A
        creature's ability to hear the approach of a distant rider,
        figure out the tell of a bluffing gambler, calm a rearing
        horse, or track a monster across the tundra is determined
        by Intuition.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="presence" class="level4">
        <h4>PRESENCE</h4>
        <p>Presence (PRS) represents force of personality. A
        creature's ability to lie to a judge, convince a crowd to
        join a revolution, impress a queen at a royal banquet, or
        cast a magic spell by singing a song is determined by
        Presence.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="characteristic-scores" class="level4">
        <h4>CHARACTERISTIC SCORES</h4>
        <p>Each characteristic has a score that runs from −5 to +5.
        The higher a score, the more impact the creature has with
        that characteristic. A baby bunny rabbit would have a Might
        score of −5, while an ancient dragon would have a Might
        score of 5. The average human has a score of 0 in all their
        characteristics. Characteristic scores are added to power
        rolls—the dice rolls you make whenever your character
        attempts a task with an uncertain outcome (see Power
        Rolls).</p>

    <section id="dice" class="level3">
      <h3>DICE</h3>
      <p>This game uses ten-sided dice (also called d10s). Each
      player and the Director should have two of these. The game
      also makes occasional use of a six-sided die (called a d6),
      so it's helpful if each player has one or two of those as
      well.</p>
      <section id="d3s" class="level4">
        <h4>D3S</h4>
        <p>On rare occasions, the rules ask a player to roll one or
        more three-sided dice (also called d3s). If you don't have
        a d3, you can roll a six-sided die instead, treating a roll
        of 1–2 as a 1, a roll of 3–4 as a 2, and a roll of 5–6 as a
        3.</p>

    <section id="power-rolls" class="level3">
      <h3>POWER ROLLS</h3>
      <p>Whenever a hero or other creature in the game attempts a
      task with an uncertain outcome, such as attacking a foe,
      sneaking by a guard patrol without being seen, or persuading
      a queen to provide military aid, the creature makes a power
      roll to determine the outcome of their actions.</p>
      <section id="types-of-power-rolls" class="level4">
        <h4>TYPES OF POWER ROLLS</h4>
        <p>The game uses three types of power rolls:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ability Roll</strong>: Used when you activate
          certain abilities to determine their impact.</li>
          <li><strong>Resistance Roll</strong>: Made to avoid
          harmful effects.</li>
          <li><strong>Test</strong>: Made outside of using your
          abilities to affect or interact with the world around
          you.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="making-a-power-roll" class="level4">
        <h4>MAKING A POWER ROLL</h4>
        <p>When you make a power roll, you roll two ten-sided dice
        (sometimes noted as 2d10 in the rules) and add one of your
        characteristics. The characteristic you add depends on the
        kind of roll you're making, as outlined in Abilities and
        Tests.</p>
        <section id="power-roll-outcomes" class="level5">
          <h5>POWER ROLL OUTCOMES</h5>
          <p>The result of a power roll determines your outcome
          tier—three levels that determine how successful your
          power roll is.</p>
          <p><strong>Tier 1</strong>: If your power roll result is
          11 or lower, it is a tier 1 result. This is the worst
          result a power roll can have. If you're using an ability,
          a tier 1 result means you still do something, but the
          impact of what you do is minimal. With this result, an
          attack ability might deal a little bit of damage and not
          do much else. For a test, a tier 1 result means you fail
          at what you set out to do, and you might also suffer a
          negative consequence.</p>
          <p><strong>Tier 2</strong>: If your power roll result is
          12 to 16, it is a tier 2 result. This is the average
          result of many power rolls, especially for heroes who are
          1st level. When using an ability, a tier 2 result means
          that what you do has a moderate impact. With this result,
          an attack ability deals a decent amount of damage and has
          an effect that briefly helps allies or hinders enemies.
          For a test, a tier 2 result means you might succeed at
          what you set out to do— though depending on the
          difficulty, success might have a cost.</p>
          <p><strong>Tier 3</strong>: If your power roll result is
          17 or higher, it is a tier 3 result. This is the best
          result a power roll can have. When using an ability, a
          tier 3 result means you deliver the maximum impact
          possible. With this result, an attack ability deals a lot
          of damage and has a powerful or lasting effect on enemies
          or allies. For a test, a tier 3 result means you succeed
          at what you set out to do. If the test has an easy
          difficulty, you also get a little something extra in
          addition to your success</p>
        </section>
        <section id="downgrade-a-power-roll" class="level5">
          <h5>DOWNGRADE A POWER ROLL</h5>
          <p>Whenever you make a power roll, you can downgrade it
          to select the result of a lower tier. For instance, if an
          ability has a tier 3 result that lets you impose the
          restrained condition on a creature, but the tier 2 result
          for that ability lets you impose the slowed condition,
          you can use the tier 2 result if you would rather have
          the creature slowed than restrained.</p>
          <p>If you downgrade a critical hit, you still get the
          extra action benefit of the critical hit (see Critical
          Hit in Abilities).</p>
        </section>
        <section id="natural-result" class="level5">
          <h5>NATURAL RESULT</h5>
          <p>The result of your power roll before your
          characteristic or any other modifiers are applied is
          called the natural result. The rules often refer to this
          as “rolling a natural X,” where X is the result of the
          roll. For example, if you get a 20 on the power roll
          before adding your characteristic, this is called rolling
          a natural 20.</p>
          <p>Whenever you roll a natural 19 or 20 on a power roll,
          you always achieve the tier 3 result, no matter what
          characteristic is added to the roll.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section id="edges-and-banes" class="level4">
        <h4>EDGES AND BANES</h4>
        <p>An archer standing on a castle wall fires down into a
        throng of enemies, hitting the mark each time thanks to
        their high ground. A drunken bandit struggles to land blows
        on sober opponents as alcohol clouds their senses. Under
        certain circumstances, you need more than just a
        characteristic to represent the advantages and
        disadvantages that heroes, their enemies, and their allies
        might have.</p>
        <section id="edge" class="level5">
          <h5>EDGE</h5>
          <p>An edge represents a situational advantage a hero or
          an enemy has when making a power roll. For example, a
          standing hero who makes a melee attack against a prone
          creature gains an edge on the power roll for their
          attack. A pair of magic gloves that makes your hands
          sticky might grant you an edge when making a power roll
          to climb walls!</p>
          <p>When you make a power roll with a single edge, you add
          2 to the roll. If you make a power roll with two or more
          edges, you have a double edge. This means you don't add
          anything to the power roll, but the result of the roll
          automatically improves one tier (to a maximum of tier
          3).</p>
        </section>
        <section id="bane" class="level5">
          <h5>BANE</h5>
          <p>A bane represents a situational disadvantage a hero or
          an enemy has when making a power roll. For example, if
          you make an attack while prone, the power roll for the
          attack takes a bane. A rainstorm might give you a bane on
          a power roll made to climb an outdoor wall because the
          weather makes the stone surface extra slick.</p>
          <p>When you make a power roll with a single bane, you
          subtract 2 from the roll. If you make a power roll with
          two or more banes, you have a double bane. This means you
          don't subtract anything from the power roll, but the
          result of the roll automatically decreases one tier (to a
          minimum of tier 1).</p>
        </section>
        <section id="rolling-with-edges-and-banes" class="level5">
          <h5>ROLLING WITH EDGES AND BANES</h5>
          <p>Under certain circumstances, you might have one or
          more edges and banes on the same roll. For instance, you
          might take a bane when weakened by poison, even as you
          gain an edge for attacking a prone creature. In general,
          edges and banes cancel each other out, resolving as
          follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you have an edge and a bane, or if you have a
            double edge and a double bane, the roll is made as
            usual without any edges or banes.</li>
            <li>If you have a double edge and just one bane, the
            roll is made with one edge, regardless of how many
            single edge instances contribute to the double
            edge.</li>
            <li>If you have a double bane and just one edge, the
            roll is made with one bane, regardless of how many
            single bane instances contribute to the double
            bane.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="when-to-use-edges-and-banes" class="level5">
          <h5>WHEN TO USE EDGES AND BANES</h5>
          <p>The rules tell you when to modify a roll with an edge
          or a bane. The Director can also modify rolls with edges
          and banes as a response to narrative or environmental
          circumstances. For instance, no rule specifically says
          that rain imposes a bane on power rolls made to climb a
          stone wall. But it makes sense that rainy conditions
          should make climbing that wall harder, so a Director
          should absolutely do so!</p>
        </section>
        <section id="why-cap" class="level5">
          <h5>WHY CAP?</h5>
          <blockquote>
            <p>We capped edges and banes at a maximum of two each
            for several reasons, including thinking about the
            narrative of those penalties. Every little advantage or
            disadvantage in a heroic story has diminishing returns,
            acknowledging that a creature can only benefit or be
            hindered by short-term circumstances so much. For
            example, a character who is prone and weakened by
            poison already finds it difficult to attack—so that
            becoming restrained by a net can't really make it
            harder.</p>
            <p>We also liked capping edges and banes at two because
            it keeps play quick. It's nice to not need to count
            beyond two positive or negative circumstances in a
            battle with a lot of effects flying around.</p>

        <h4>BONUSES AND PENALTIES</h4>
        <p>While edges and banes cover most circumstantial effects
        that can have an impact on a power roll, a few rules add
        numeric bonuses or penalties to power rolls. Bonus and
        penalty values are specified in the rules that impose them,
        and are calculated independently of edges and banes, and
        before edges and banes are factored into a power roll.
        There is no limit to the number of bonuses or penalties
        that can apply to a power roll, and bonuses and penalties
        always add together.</p>
        <p>Though it might sound as if the math with bonuses and
        penalties can get confusing, fear not! Bonuses and
        penalties are rare except in the case of skills, which

      <h3>HERO TOKENS</h3>
      <p>When players roleplay their heroes well or take big risks,
      the Director can reward them with the potential to restore
      vitality when it's needed, in the form of hero tokens. Hero
      tokens are given out by the Director one at a time, either to
      an individual player or to the group as a whole. They can be
      tracked using poker chips, stones, or other markers, and are
      then shared by all players.</p>
      <p>Whenever hero tokens are available, you can spend a hero
      token on your turn or whenever you take damage (no action
      required). When you do, you regain Stamina equal to your
      recovery value without spending a Recovery. A hero token
      benefits only one creature at a time, and you can't spend
      more than one hero token per turn.</p>
      <p>Players can also be awarded hero tokens as part of a
      test's outcome when they succeed in a task with a reward (see
      Tests). Unless the Director decides otherwise, unused hero
      tokens disappear at the end of a session.</p>

        <h4>FOR THE DIRECTOR: AWARDING HERO TOKENS</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>You can award hero tokens to the players for taking
          risks with their heroes beyond what the game typically
          expects of them. For instance, battling a group of
          monsters is part of the game and doesn't earn a hero
          token. However, the following sorts of activities
          might:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A hero stands alone against a group of enemies to
            allow their comrades to escape.</li>
            <li>A hero willingly jumps into quicksand, into lava,
            off a cliff, or into some other hazard to save another
            character.</li>
            <li>The group is presented with an easy way out of a
            difficult situation that involves lying, cheating,
            stealing, or the like, but they take the more arduous
            and honorable path.</li>
            <li>A hero gives away an important resource, such as a
            Healing Potion, to help another creature in need.</li>

      <h3>GAME OF EXCEPTIONS</h3>
      <p>This game has a fair number of rules. But it also has
      plenty of character options, specialized equipment, and other
      game elements that let you break those rules. This is on
      purpose! Breaking the rules allows heroes to feel special and
      makes their foes seem extra dangerous.</p>
      <p>If you're not sure what to do when two rules come into
      conflict with each other, remember that a specific exception
      always beats a more general rule. The Director has the final
      say in how rules are adjudicated.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="always-round-down" class="level3">
      <h3>ALWAYS ROUND DOWN</h3>
      <p>There are times when the rules tell you to divide a number
      in half. Whenever you divide an odd number in half and it
      results in a decimal, round the result down to the nearest
      whole number. For instance, if you have a speed of 7 and
      become slowed (a condition that halves your speed), then your
      speed becomes 3.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="creatures-and-objects" class="level3">
      <h3>CREATURES AND OBJECTS</h3>
      <p>This game uses the terms “creature” and “object.”
      Creatures are living or unliving beings such as animals,
      elves, humans, dragons, giants, zombies, and valok. Objects
      are inanimate matter such as walls, carriages, cups, swords,
      ropes, coins, paintings, columns, and buildings. Creatures
      always have stat blocks that relay their statistics, but
      objects do not.</p>
      <p>When a creature dies, their body becomes an object, and
      can be affected by abilities and other effects that target
      objects. For example, a talent can't use their Telekinesis
      power to slide an unwilling enemy cult leader into an evil
      temple's pit of hellfire. But if that boss dies, the talent
      can slide their body into the pit to prevent the boss from
      being raised as a powerful undead by the temple's magic.</p>
      <p>The game sometimes refers to “unattended objects,” which
      are objects that aren't held, worn, or controlled by a
      creature. Whenever an ability affects objects, it affects
      only unattended objects unless the Director determines
      otherwise.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="pcs-and-npcs" class="level3">
      <h3>PCS AND NPCS</h3>
      <p>Two types of characters inhabit the world of the game— the
      player characters (also called PCs or heroes) who are created
      and controlled by the players, and nonplayer characters
      (NPCs) created and controlled by the Director. NPCs can
      include any of the game's monsters, but when the rules refer
      to NPCs, they generally do so in the context of interacting
      with them outside of combat.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="building-a-heroic-narrative" class="level3">
      <h3>BUILDING A HEROIC NARRATIVE</h3>
      <p>The game takes place in a series of scenes with the heroes
      as the main characters. An adventure is a collection of
      scenes that make up a single story arc, and a campaign is a
      collection of adventures that tell the entire epic tale of a
      group of heroes. You can think of each adventure as a movie
      in a saga of films, a book in a series of novels, or a season
      of a television show. While many heroes have their stories
      told over the course of a campaign, some wrap up their
      careers in a single adventure that takes place in one game
      session, called a one-shot. You can think of a one-shot as a
      great stand-alone novella or movie.</p>
      <p>This game is built so that each adventure you play and
      each battle you fight gets more exciting as it goes on. In
      fantastic tales, the heroes and their foes both grow in power
      over the course of an adventure. But it isn't time alone that
      grows a hero's capabilities. Rather, it's the adrenaline that
      comes from battle, the danger of the hero's profession, and
      the pressure to save the world that pushes a character to do
      the impossible. Each small act of heroism gives a hero the
      confidence and bravery to perform legendary feats against all
      odds.</p>
      <p>The things a hero can achieve at the end of the story are
      far more daring and impactful than what they do at the start,
      and the final showdown against a villain's forces is more
      deadly and desperate than the first. The rules of the game
      help build a heroic narrative in this same fashion, making
      use of the four most important mechanics for building heroic
      narratives: Victories, Experience, Heroic Resources, and
      Recoveries.</p>
      <section id="victories" class="level4">
        <h4>VICTORIES</h4>
        <p>Your hero's power increases throughout an adventure as
        you fight more battles and overcome other challenges,
        measured through a stat called Victories. At the start of
        an adventure, your hero has 0 Victories.</p>
        <section id="victories-after-combat" class="level5">
          <h5>VICTORIES AFTER COMBAT</h5>
          <p>Each time your hero survives a combat encounter in
          which the party's objectives are achieved, your Victories
          increase by 1. The Director can decide that a trivially
          easy encounter doesn't increase a hero's Victories.</p>

          <h5>VICTORIES AFTER NONCOMBAT CHALLENGES</h5>
          <p>When your hero successfully overcomes a big challenge
          that doesn't involve combat, the Director can award you 1
          Victory. Such challenges can include things like a
          particularly complicated and deadly trap, a negotiation,
          a montage test, a complicated puzzle, or the execution of
          a clever idea that avoids a battle.</p>

        <h4>FOR THE DIRECTOR: AWARDING VICTORIES</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>We're still figuring out rules for encounter building,
          but here are some general guidelines.</p>
          <p>A successful combat in which the party's objectives
          are achieved earns the heroes 1 Victory. Particularly
          hard encounters are worth 2 Victories when completed.
          We'll have better guidelines on this topic in the future,
          but for now, consider tough boss battles worth 2
          Victories.</p>
          <p>A successful negotiation or montage test should earn
          the heroes 1 Victory. Other noncombat challenges are left
          to the Director's discretion, but consider the following
          guidelines to help you determine when awarding 1 Victory
          is warranted:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the heroes overcome a complicated trap that
            requires more than one test to find and disarm, award
            them 1 Victory.</li>
            <li>If the heroes investigate a series of clues in a
            mystery, award 1 Victory when they solve the
            mystery.</li>
            <li>If the heroes solve a complicated puzzle that
            requires them to use resources or would take most
            people at least 10 minutes to complete, award them a
            Victory.</li>
            <li>If the heroes achieve a major story goal that
            accomplishes a quest (such as saving a prince trapped
            by an evil baroness or stopping a necromancer from
            performing a world-ending ritual), award them 1
            Victory.</li>
            <li>If the heroes use clever thinking to easily and
            surprisingly overcome or bypass a combat encounter, a
            negotiation, a montage test, a trap, a puzzle, or some
            other challenge that would award them 1 or more
            Victories in a more difficult fashion, award them 1
            Victory. Clever thinking is just as worthy of a
            Victory—if not more so!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>At the Director's discretion, particularly hard
          negotiations, puzzles, mysteries, and other noncombat
          challenges can be worth 2 Victories.</p>

      </section>
      <section id="experience" class="level4">
        <h4>EXPERIENCE</h4>
        <p>Victories temporarily increase a hero's power during an
        adventure, but Experience (or XP) permanently improves
        their capabilities. Each time you finish a respite (see
        below), you gain XP equal to your Victories, then your
        Victories drop to 0. In other words, your Victories are
        converted to XP when you finish a respite.</p>
        <p>For more information on how XP increases your hero's
        power, see Heroic Advancement.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="heroic-resources" class="level4">
        <h4>HEROIC RESOURCES</h4>
        <p>Your hero has a Heroic Resource (sometimes two Heroic
        Resources) determined by your class, and which you manage
        during play. For many classes, earning Resources can
        increase your hero's power, and Resources are spent to
        activate your most powerful abilities. Other classes, like
        the talent, earn a negative resource that gives them a
        penalty during battle, and they gain the resource to
        activate their most powerful abilities. Each class gains
        and uses its Heroic Resource differently, and resources
        aren't equivalent across classes. For example, 1 piety for
        the conduit isn't worth as much as 1 focus for the
        tactician.</p>
        <p>Some classes, such as the tactician and the fury,
        generate and use Heroic Resources only during combat
        encounters. Others, such as the shadow and the talent, can
        use their Heroic Resources both in and out of combat.</p>
        <p>Your hero's class description has more information about
        how to use your Heroic Resource.</p>

      <section id="bags-of-rats-aint-heroic" class="level4">
        <h4>BAGS OF RATS AIN'T HEROIC</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Some players might think that quickly starting a fight
          with some bar patrons or carrying around a bag of rats is
          a good way to gather up those sweet, sweet Victories and
          Heroic Resources. Those strategies don't work! The rules
          of the game exist to help you tell a cool heroic fantasy
          story, not so you can try to be clever and exploit them
          by harming innocent rats to “win.” In order to generate
          Victories and Heroic Resources, you must face and
          overcome challenges worthy of a hero!</p>
        </blockquote>
      </section>
      <section id="recoveries" class="level4">
        <h4>RECOVERIES</h4>
        <p>Each hero has a limited number of Recoveries that they
        can use to heal themself. Recoveries are a way to rally and
        get back some of the energy you lose in battle by taking a
        breather, accepting a little magical help from a conduit or
        troubadour, getting an allied tactician to inspire you with
        a rush of adrenaline, and so forth. Of course, your body
        can only rally so many times before your energy reserves
        are completely shot, so you have a limited number of
        recoveries as a result.</p>
        <p>When you spend a Recovery, you regain Stamina equal to
        your recovery value, which is one-third your Stamina
        maximum.</p>
        <section id="spending-recoveries" class="level5">
          <h5>SPENDING RECOVERIES</h5>
          <p>During combat encounters and similarly dangerous
          situations when time is tracked in rounds (see Combat),
          you can use the Catch Breath action to regain Stamina.
          See Catch Breath in Actions for more information. Some
          heroes have abilities that allow them or their allies to
          spend more Recoveries without using the Catch Breath
          action.</p>
          <p>Outside of combat and other dangerous situations, you
          can spend Recoveries freely.</p>

      </section>
      <section id="respite" class="level4">
        <h4>RESPITE</h4>
        <p>A respite is a focused period of rest and recuperation
        that allows heroes to regain Stamina and Recoveries. During
        a respite, you must spend 24 hours uninterrupted and doing
        nothing but sleeping, eating, dressing your wounds, and
        recuperating. You can also undertake one respite activity,
        such as making a project roll (see Research and Crafting in
        future packets for more information), or changing your kit
        (see Kits).</p>
        <p>When you finish a respite, you regain all your
        Recoveries and Stamina, and your Victories convert to
        Experience. It is best to take a respite in a safe place
        where you aren't in a hostile environment or at risk of
        being attacked. If your respite is interrupted by enemies
        attacking, an earth tremor, swarms of biting insects, and
        similar serious distractions, the respite ends early and
        you don't gain the benefits for finishing it.</p>
        <p>The standard eightish hours of sleep one gets at night
        doesn't count as a respite. The rules assume that all
        heroes take the time to sleep, eat, and take care of all
        the other functions necessary for life even if they aren't
        engaged in a respite.</p>

      <h3>ORDEN AND THE TIMESCAPE</h3>
      <p>A new game demands new worlds! Welcome to the timescape—a
      collection of worlds spanning high fantasy, dark fantasy, and
      even space fantasy! We sincerely hope you take these rules
      and adapt them to your own world, or adapt your world to
      these rules, or something in between!</p>
      <p>Our tour begins on the world of Orden, the Prime
      Manifold—a realm of elves, dwarves, humans, orcs, dragons,
      and more. But human civilization and politics dominate here,
      especially in the great city of Capital, a hotbed of urban
      fantasy intrigue.</p>
      <p>Orden contains seven major regions, the largest of which
      is Vasloria.</p>
      <section id="vasloria" class="level4">
        <h4>VASLORIA</h4>
        <p>A forested medieval and feudal land, Vasloria holds few
        cities—just towns and villages. Western Vasloria, including
        most of Aendrim and Corwell and parts of Graid, was until
        recently ruled by Good King Omund. His draconian knights,
        the Dragon Phalanx, protected the weak from the strong,
        dispensing justice throughout the land. But Omund died
        fifteen years ago—and so died the rule of law in Vasloria.
        Now, forests claim towns and roads once held safe under his
        rule. The woods are dangerous, their only law that of tooth
        and claw.</p>
        <p>When Omund was betrayed by Mandrake, a captain of the
        Dragon Phalanx, his castle fell to Ajax the Invincible—now
        called the Overlord and the Iron Saint. Ajax's wizard
        Mortum unlocked the secret of the ancient flying cities of
        the sky elves to raise the Chrysopolis, Ajax's
        city-fortress in the sky.</p>
        <p>Ajax abolished all faiths and temples in Vasloria. He
        executed the dukes who served King Omund loyally, leaving
        only the three surviving baronies of Dalrath, Bedegar, and
        Tor to hold human civilization together. Once, the people
        of all the lands of Vasloria were loose allies. There was
        trade between humans, elves, dwarves, and orcs.</p>
        <p>Now there is only suspicion.</p>
        <p>The high elves of the Fallen City, once the sky elf city
        of Irranys, pay tribute to Ajax with ancient artifacts they
        plunder from their ruined home. The wode elves of the
        Orchid Court, lacking any centralized government or cities,
        refuse to bow to the Iron Saint.</p>
        <p>The dwarves of Kal Kalavar pay tribute in prisoners they
        abduct from among those foolish enough to travel the roads
        unescorted—prisoners who serve Ajax as forced labor or are
        fed into the Body Banks. Brooding under the mountains in
        their fabled Hanging City of Kal Kalavar, the stone dwarves
        do not like this deal with the Overlord, but they lack the
        power—or perhaps the will—to rebel.</p>
        <p>The Hawklords of the High Aerie now act as Ajax's royal
        guard. Mounted on their giant hawks, these human warriors
        project Ajax's power, enforce his tyrannical order, and
        extend his influence into every corner of the wilderness.
        Their mastery of the air means that any revolt or rebellion
        is seen and crushed quickly.</p>
        <p>The Dragon Phalanx is broken now, its knights scattered.
        Ajax has placed a high bounty on their heads. Some folk
        still see Omund's knights as symbols of justice, heroes of
        a lost age before might made right. But in every town,
        every village, there are always desperate people willing to
        collect the bounty, summoning the Hawklords to pluck any
        dragon knight foolish enough to travel without a disguise
        away to the Chrysopolis.</p>
        <p>The peoples of Dalrath, Bedegar, and Tor, isolated and
        outnumbered, desperately fight a losing battle against the
        encroaching wilderness. Law dies. Chaos thrives.</p>

      <section id="capital" class="level4">
        <h4>CAPITAL</h4>
        <p>The Greatest City in This or Any Age! City of the Great
        Game! Located west across the Bale Sea from Vasloria on the
        eastern coast of Rioja, Capital is not only the largest
        city in Orden. It's the largest city there has ever
        been—larger than the fabled steel dwarf capital of Kalas
        Valiar, larger even than Alloy, the City at the Center of
        the Timescape. Capital is the exception to many rules.</p>
        <p>It is a city of playwrights and opera, of spies and
        sorcery. Famed throughout the world as a city of high magic
        where flying tapestries act as taxis. But the reality of
        living in Capital is somewhat more mundane, for only the
        very wealthy can afford such luxuries.</p>
        <section id="the-great-houses" class="level5">
          <h5>THE GREAT HOUSES</h5>
          <p>The Great Houses, Capital's ancient noble families,
          reluctantly share power with the upstart guilds who think
          that their vast wealth entitles them to rule. The members
          of the Great Houses are proud of their city, and believe
          anyone, from anywhere, should be able to come to Capital
          and earn a living, own property, and expect justice. They
          just don't think anyone else should be able to rule. The
          guilds of the city, by contrast, are more egalitarian,
          more democratic, largely obsessed with accruing
          wealth—and caring little for the welfare of the city or
          its people.</p>
          <p>The Great Game is espionage, and House Alvaro are the
          best players in the world. Led by Duke Prospero, House
          Alvaro sponsors the Imperial University, the greatest
          center of learning in the world. Nobles from across
          Orden, including from lands as far away as Vanigar, send
          their children to learn diplomacy and statecraft at the
          university. The greatest spies in the world are all
          graduates of the Actian School, one of the university's
          many colleges, which once doubled as the intelligence
          agency of Capital's late prince.</p>
          <p>House Vorona runs the city's navy, the largest
          military organization of any kind in Orden. Their
          engineers perfected the secret of blackpowder and guard
          it jealously.</p>
          <p>The Imperial Navy's canons protect trade across Orden,
          placing Capital at the center of international affairs.
          Vorona's Far Mariners, aka the marines, are the closest
          thing to a citywide law enforcement organization. Each
          Great House is expected to police its own district.</p>
          <p>Duke Marco Vorona sponsors the Imperial War College,
          also known as the Academy. A prestigious institution
          rivaling any college of the Imperial University, the
          Academy boasts graduates among all the noble families in
          Orden. This widespread allegiance creates a vast informal
          network in the city, referred to cynically as the Old
          Class Ring, that gives House Vorona access to
          intelligence that other factions can only dream of.</p>
          <p>House Navarr, the oldest of the Great Houses, enforces
          the law of the Church of Saint Ysabella the Pitiless,
          which theycall justice. The house is led by His Grace
          Orsino, Duke Navarr, archbishop of that most powerful
          church in the city. Under his rule, House Navarr
          consolidates a vast network of different churches and
          knights across the region under one elaborate system of
          patronage.</p>
          <p>Arguably the most powerful Great House, House Valetta
          controls the city's tax collectors, known as the Arbitros
          Fiat. Valetta is led by the Duchess Lenore, who opened
          theCodex Mortis while in mourning for her assassinated
          husband Maximo, speaking a ritual from that ancient
          necromantic artifact that should have returned her love
          to life. Instead, she brought about the Lilac Night,
          which transformed everyone in her district into
          undead—including herself. The Duchess Lenore is now an
          immortal vampire queen, a dead lady ruling over a dead
          city.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="the-power-of-the-guilds" class="level5">
          <h5>THE POWER OF THE GUILDS</h5>
          <p>After the Lilac Night, with the city no longer able to
          rely on House Valetta to deliver the taxes it collected,
          Lady Shirome bought Great House status for the
          Fulcrum—the city's assayer's guild she controls—along
          with the Broadsheet Guild and the Farrier's Guild. The
          Fulcrum controls the Trade Integrity Board, which sets
          lending rates and leads trade negotiations between
          Capital and other governments in Orden. It was that guild
          that convinced the late prince to switch the city to
          paper money. As a result, Capital is the first and only
          city in Orden to have a robust monetary policy.</p>
          <p>The Broadsheet Guild, formally known as the Font,
          publishes the thrice-daily news sheets that everyone in
          the city reads. Guildmaster Inān al-Adwiyya uses a vast
          network of young people called the Paperfeathers to
          deliver and sell the broadsheets throughout the city.
          Lady al-Adwiyya knows almost everything happening
          anywhere in Capital.</p>
          <p>The Farrier's Guild, popularly known as the Rasp,
          controls transport throughout the city. The guild is led
          by Lord Kashimir, a heliox from the planar gateway city
          of Alloy. It was he who introduced the flying tapestries
          that metaphorically shrank Capital, allowing the rich and
          powerful to cross the thirteen-mile-wide city in just a
          few minutes. He also created the Kites, couriers famous
          for being able to get a message to anywhere in Capital in
          only a few hours. His monopoly on importing flying
          tapestries from Alloy gives Lord Kashimir enormous power,
          and he is not shy about wanting more.</p>

        <h4>THE MYRIAD WORLDS OF THE TIMESCAPE</h4>
        <p>Orden is only one world in the timescape! Each star in
        the night sky is another world, though this fact is not
        known to most people living on Orden. Higher worlds are
        more energetic, affording access to alien technologies.
        Great star freighters ply the space lanes, with knights
        wielding psionically powered hard-light blades dueling
        against star pirates with hard-light blasters.</p>
        <p>The lower worlds lack the energy necessary for such
        extraordinary technology to function, and so rely on magic
        to break the rules.</p>
        <p>On Axiom, the Plane of Uttermost Law, the memonek live
        on a world teeming with complex, inorganic life. UNISOL,
        the Universal Solar League, ensures and protects trade
        across the upper worlds, defending the star freighters from
        pirates such as the time raiders and the infamous
        Sunrunners on their legendary ship the K.R.A.D
        Fearless.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, on Proteus, the Sea of Eternal Change, the
        formless proteans rebelled against the synlirii who once
        ruled the plane of uttermost chaos, exiling the voiceless
        talkers to the World Below. Now the masters of their world,
        the proteans take to the stars in their living
        change-ships, hurling their small fleet against what they
        perceive as the tyrannical might of UNISOL.</p>
        <p>On Quintessence, the lowest of the upper worlds,
        proteans and memonek alike rub shoulders with devils, fire
        dwarves, and even humans in Quintessence's capital city of
        Alloy, the City at the Center of the Timescape. The Free
        City of Alloy, also known as the City of Brass, is the
        gateway to the timescape. People traveling to or from the
        upper and lower worlds meet here to trade goods and
        information, free from the inflexible laws of UNISOL.</p>
        <p>Traveling downward from Quintessence, one arrives on
        Orden, the Plane of Gods and Sorcery, highest of the lower
        worlds where magic rules. The gods, forbidden from
        interfering directly in a world with such a low energy
        state, rely on saints to enact their will. The technology
        from the upper worlds does not function down here, unless
        powered by a strong psionic mind, or the miracle mineral
        prismacore.</p>
        <p>Almost coterminous with Orden is its sister-plane, the
        World Below, and the Dark Under All. This plane of exiles
        is ruled by A Lie Cloaked In Star's Silver—the Queen of
        Night, and the first of the Three Sisters Below. The World
        Below is a land of vast caves and sunless seas. There are
        no stars here, no sky, but only endless caves and warrens.
        Some of those are vast enough to hold entire cities,
        including Or-Mazaar, the City of the Black Star, from where
        the Queen of Night rules.</p>
        <p>The power of the World Below wanes, even as the power of
        Equinox rises. Also known as Dusk, this smaller parasitic
        manifold is home to the exiled shadow elves and ruled by
        the Queen of Shadows, third of the Three Sisters Below. She
        plots to return her people to their homeland in Orden, and
        to escape the twisted shadow world.</p>
        <p>The last plane of law, the Seven Cities of Hell, is
        among the lowest of the lower planes. A realm of devils
        proud of their civilization, the Seven Cities are each
        ruled by an archduke who schemes to ascend to the Throne of
        Hell. Living in a world of bureaucratic law, the devil
        denizens of Hell have little interest in the other planes.
        Life is so much more interesting down here. The seven dukes
        of Hell conspired together once, agreeing to create the
        Order of Desolation, also known as the illriggers. Doing so
        was meant to extend their power into the timescape, and to
        defend the Seven Cities from the demon hordes below.</p>
        <p>The demons of the Abyssal Waste, the lowest plane, claw
        and scramble over each other, competing for souls in this
        heat-blasted desert under a baleful, giant orange sun.
        Mindless collections of organs, claws, and teeth, demons
        collect souls until they reach sentience, gaining identity
        and the blessing of memory. These demons will do anything
        to escape upward out of the wasteland, lest they lose their
        collected souls, lose their identities, and fall into that
        mindless state called lethe.</p>
        <p>At the center of the Abyssal Waste lies the Necropolitan
        Ruin, the Last City. A great city of the dead, the site is
        ruled by Khorsekef, once the Infinite Pharaoh of the desert
        wasteland of Khemhara, now the Ultralich. Khorsekef intends
        to return to Orden and sit once again on his throne in the
        grand Heliopolis at the center of Khemhara—and he has a
        plan …</p>

        <h4>THE TIMESCAPE IN YOUR GAME</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>We use the timescape and its medieval fantasy land
          Orden as the default setting presented in these books.
          Doing so makes it easier for us as designers to marry our
          design with real examples from a real (imaginary) fantasy
          world. We also think it's easier for you to take the
          names for places, languages, and gods, and replace them
          with your own. We might reference some hero or villain,
          saint or god, whose name makes you think, “Well, I don't
          have that in my setting.” If we do a good job, though,
          you might be inspired to say, “But that makes me think …”
          And being inspired is part of the fun!</p>
          <p>If you're the Director, you can use as many or as few
          of the details of the timescape as you like. You might
          wish to create your own world within the timescape, or
          use a setting you've created that exists outside of the
          official MCDM manifolds. You can use details from
          settings published by other companies. There are no rules
          when it comes to world-building. Feel free to take what
          you like from this book and change the rest. For example,
          you might not care for our dwarves having literal stone
          skin. That's fine. You can make them fleshy, stout,
          bearded folk, or mohawked, barrel-chested punk rockers,
          or anything else you wish. As long as you're running a
          heroic fantasy campaign about fighting monsters, then the
          game's rules are still likely to serve your narrative
          even if that narrative deviates from ours.</p>
          <p>If you're a player, ask your Director about the
          setting where the game takes place and discuss with them
          the sort of hero you want to create. Maybe you want to
          play a more traditional gruff and bearded dwarf rather
          than go all short and stony. An open dialogue and honest
          discussion with your Director can lead to everyone
          getting what they want out of the game.</p>

    <h2>MAKING A HERO</h2>
    <p>If you're not the Director, then you create and play one of
    the main characters in the game's story—a hero. Your hero is a
    person motivated to fight forces of evil to protect the
    innocent, but each hero has their own personal reason for doing
    so. You don't have to be a pure beacon of good. Heroes have
    flaws and are complex, just like people in the real world. But
    your hero should be someone who isn't afraid to battle monsters
    for altruistic reasons. If you're only interested in playing a
    money-grubbing sellsword, you can achieve that with these
    rules, but you'll likely be happier playing another game.</p>
    <p>The hero you create will be roleplayed by you. Often when
    referring to your hero, the rules use second-person pronouns
    (you/your) for shorthand, only making a distinction between you
    and your hero when that distinction is important.</p>
    <section id="your-first-session" class="level3">
      <h3>YOUR FIRST SESSION</h3>
      <p>Getting together with your friends to make characters can
      be a lot of fun. Many groups spend most of their first
      session talking about the campaign's story, making heroes,
      and going over expectations for the game. It's a great way to
      kick off a long-term campaign.</p>
      <p>The Director should make an agenda for a campaign's first
      session—often called “session zero”—which can include any of
      the following items:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Director and players talk about the safety tools
        they want to employ at the game table (whether physical or
        virtual), so that everyone has a good time and understands
        which topics should be avoided in the game's narrative and
        which should be embraced. For more information, check out
        the MCDM Tabletop Safety Toolkit at mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit,
        which includes advice for running a successful session
        zero.</li>
        <li>The Director discusses the campaign's world and the
        major story themes they want to introduce into the
        game.</li>
        <li>The players get a chance to tell the Director what they
        would like to see in the campaign. This can include
        anything from “I'd love to play out some chase scenes!” to
        “I want to explore themes of loss and grief.” These wishes
        should be starting points for a conversation. If not all
        players are comfortable with certain themes or content
        requested by other players, then session zero is a great
        time to discuss that and come to a consensus about what
        everyone wants out of the game.</li>
        <li>Make heroes! Once everyone understands what the
        campaign is about, it's the perfect time to get into
        character creation. When a group of players make heroes
        together, they can tie backstories together and strategize
        to build a tactically dominant party both in and out of
        combat.</li>
        <li>The Director runs an encounter to kick off the
        campaign. If all the players have the time, it's totally
        worth it to get some play in during the first session, even
        if it's just a quick brawl in a tavern with some cultists!
        Giving the players a little action lets them see what the
        game is all about—and leaves them excited for the next
        session.</li>

      <h3>STEP-BY-STEP HERO MAKING</h3>
      <p>Use the following step-by-step guide to create a hero.
      These steps are presented in what we believe is the best way
      to approach making your first hero for <em>Draw Steel</em>.
      That said, the order of the steps is still a suggestion, not
      a hard and fast rule.</p>
      <p>Many players like to build a hero from the backstory up,
      making ancestry and culture ideal first choices. However,
      some players like to start more in the present, choosing an
      inciting incident and a class—the choices with the most
      potential impact on what your character can do in the
      game—and then going back and figuring out where their hero
      came from. There's no wrong way to do it!</p>
      <p>You'll want a character sheet to fill out while you make
      your hero.</p>

        <h4>1. THINK</h4>
        <p>The first thing you should do is think about the kind of
        hero you want to make. Ask yourself the following
        questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do you fight with weapons, magic, psionics, or some
          combination of these abilities?</li>
          <li>Outside of combat, what do you want your hero to do
          well?</li>
          <li>What did you do before becoming a hero?</li>
          <li>Why did you choose to become a hero?</li>
          <li>What is your personality like?</li>
          <li>What people, places, and objects are important to
          you?</li>

        knight, dwarf, hakaan, high elf, human, memonek, orc,
        polder, revenant, time raider, or wode elf. Future

        your characteristic scores and Stamina, in addition to
        skills, several abilities, and other benefits. You can be a

          meet?</li>
          <li>Another hero creates food, music, clothing, trinkets,
          or something else that you enjoy. Who is that hero and

          <h5>MILESTONE</h5>
          <p>Rather than tracking XP, some games see the heroes
          advance in level when they achieve a particular story
          milestone. For example, when a party defeats the main
          villain of an adventure and foils their dastardly plot,
          each hero gains a level for achieving this objective, no
          matter how many or few obstacles they faced along the
          way.</p>
          <p>For many Directors using milestone advancement, the
          end of each adventure within a campaign serves as a
          milestone for leveling up. The Director can share these
          milestones with the players to encourage them to work
          toward particular goals, and to engage with the story and
          world the Director has prepared. For example, in a
          campaign where the heroes have to face nine evil mages,
          it makes sense that each time the heroes defeat a mage,
          they gain a level. The Director should keep milestone
          goals flexible, though. Defeating a mage could mean
          stopping them with violence, using negotiation to make
          them stand down, or anything else that thwarts their evil
          plans.</p>

    <section id="on-the-origin-of-species" class="level3">
      <h3>ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES</h3>
      <p>Orden is a fantasy world. It works on principles similar
      to those many people throughout history believed governed the
      real world. “I dunno, a god did it probably.”</p>
      <p>Humans, elves, orcs, dwarves, dragons—all have creator
      gods—the elder gods, four of whom made the world for some
      reason. Maybe they were bored.</p>
      <p>The fashion among those gods for creating new, intelligent
      species petered after the orcs. Once humans came along and
      invented war, it stopped being fun.</p>
      <p>It may be all species were created by gods. That's
      certainly what a lot of people throughout our own history
      assumed. Orden has no Darwin and probably won't ever. There's
      still inheritance. People expect children to look like their
      parents, but there aren't evolutionary pressures except on a
      very local scale.</p>
      <p>And in a world where powerful, world-altering magics are
      available, mortals sometimes try to recreate the gods'
      efforts. Some succeed, and new intelligent, speaking peoples
      are born.</p>
      <p>However, mortals are not gods and lack their ineffable
      wisdom. They are, in fact, very effable. Many have sought the
      power to create. It is available to any sorcerer of
      near-godlike power with the right rituals, though these days
      that power is very obscure. Creating new intelligent species
      was easier for mortal wizards back in the youth of the world
      when magic was friskier.</p>
      <p>In every instance in recorded history, attempts by mortals
      to make obedient servitor species backfire. The steel dwarves
      worked marvels with valiar, the truemetal, and the miracle
      mineral prismacore that grants objects a semblance of life.
      Eventually, their science and magics produced the omnivok,
      machines that were self-aware. Perhaps uniquely, when the
      dwarves realized they had created beings equal to themselves,
      they stopped their work and gave their creation full rights
      and independence, preferring to work with them rather than
      attempt, and inevitably fail, to be their masters.</p>
      <p>Normally, it doesn't work out that nicely. Even with the
      best of intentions, things go awry. The Dragon Phalanx were
      created by Good King Omund's wizard Vitae to be the perfect
      knights, dispensing justice throughout the lands. But the
      same sorceries that grant self-awareness also grant
      independence. Agency. And though they enjoyed thirty years of
      peace and justice, eventually the dragon knights were
      betrayed by one of their own, seduced by the power offered by
      Ajax.</p>
      <p>The law of unintended consequences applies to the just and
      the unjust alike.</p>
      <p>Usually when some powerful being tries to create an
      intelligent people, it's for less than virtuous reasons. The
      synliroi are responsible for several intelligent species in
      the timescape, each an attempt to create a perfectly obedient
      servitor species. The most notorious example are the
      kuran'zoi, the time raiders who rebelled almost immediately
      and carry a burning hate for the voiceless talkers to this
      day.</p>
      <p>A perhaps less egregious use of this power is called
      quickening. Used when a powerful mage lives in and amongst
      some clever species just on the cusp of self-awareness. These
      instances, which are much more numerous than creating a new
      species from whole cloth, are more like the concept of
      uplifting found in science fiction. The mage or witch or
      shaman didn't create anything. They just gave these cute,
      clever, frog-things a little boost. A little nudge. And
      suddenly there are angualotls walking around having
      conversations with each other, wondering when someone will
      invent a fabric that doesn't get moldy in the swamp.</p>
      <p>This also carries serious ethical repercussions! “You
      didn't create angualotls! You screwed up some perfectly good
      frogs! Look at them, you gave them anxiety!”</p>
      <p>This is only how it works on Orden. You may have
      completely different explanations for why there are several
      different intelligent species walking around in your world.
      Or no explanation! Or competing and irreconcilable theories
      on the matter! Use whatever inspires you.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day, if you throw out all of this and
      replace it with something you made up, it will be better.
      Because it's <em>yours</em>!</p>

      <h3>DEVIL</h3>
      <p>“Go to hell!”</p>
      <p>“You know, I have a rather interesting story about
      that…”</p>
      <p>The native ancestry of the Seven Cities of Hell, devils
      are humanoids with red or blue skin expressed in a wide
      variety of hues, from bright crimson to deep purple. Each
      devil is born with some hellmark—horns, a tail, cloven
      hooves, a forked tongue, fanged incisors, or even wings.</p>
      <p>Hell is dominated by the Seven Cities of Hell, each ruled
      by a different archdevil who constantly plots and schemes
      against the others in the hope of ascending to the Throne of
      Hell.</p>
      <p>Those devils who join “the trade,” as their civil service
      is called, spend their days in bureaucratic service, hoping
      or scheming for promotion. Devils looking for a quick path up
      the bureaucratic ladder sign up for the Exchange, whereby
      mortals in the mundane world who perform the right rituals
      can summon a devil, who bargains with the supplicant on
      behalf of their archdevil. Archdevils can grant temporary
      worldly power in exchange for a supplicant's soul, with the
      summoned devil acting as the broker.</p>
      <p>On rare occasions, the summoning goes wrong and the
      supplicant dies before the deal can be struck, stranding the
      summoned devil on Orden permanently. Some stranded devils
      seek to return to Hell, but most prefer life in Orden, where
      the phrase “stabbed in the back by a colleague” is usually a
      metaphor.</p>
      <p>The majority of devils in Orden are not from, nor have
      ever been to, the Seven Cities. They are descendants of
      devils who were stranded in the mundane world decades,
      centuries, even millennia ago.</p>

        <h4>ON DEVILS</h4>
        <p>Adelard scuttled across the floor of his basement, a
        heavy tome clutched in one hand, his index finger marking a
        page. Occasionally he would stop, open the book, consult a
        diagram, look at the chalk markings he'd made on the floor,
        tilt his head, then bend down and refine or rub out an
        esoteric symbol.</p>
        <p>One of the red candles suddenly guttered out, making the
        small room noticeably darker. “Damn and blast!” he hissed.
        Then he relit it from another candle.</p>
        <p>Stepping back to admire his handiwork, Adelard crossed
        his arms and nodded. He'd spent his last coppers on the
        candles—they weren't cheap. And he feared the skull might
        be fake, but did it matter? The book just said <em>a
        skull</em>—it didn't even specify a human skull! Did it
        matter if it was real? It was probably real. What kind of
        market was there for replica skulls? But it was awfully
        cheap. Anyway, did it matter? How would the ritual know if
        the skull was real?</p>
        <p>He was wittering, putting off the inevitable. He pulled
        himself together. It was either going to work, or it
        wasn't, and wittering wasn't going to help. He opened the
        book and turned the page—then began to speak the
        ritual.</p>
        <p>Moments later, the candles flared, there was a burst of
        flame, and acrid brimstone filled his nostrils. When the
        smoke cleared… there was a devil standing in his
        basement—dark purple skin, horns, even a twitching
        tail.</p>
        <p>“Aha! Yes, finally.” It rubbed its hands together. “It's
        about time,” the creature said, pulling on the bottom of
        his waistcoat to straighten it. “Now then! How does it go?
        Oh, yes.” He cleared his throat. “On behalf of my lord, his
        grace Archduke Dispater, Lord of Dis, I am empowered to
        offer you…”</p>
        <p>But his speech fell on deaf ears.</p>
        <p>“It worked!” Adelard said, holding his clenched fists
        up. “Ahahaha! It worked! Finally, after years! I will have
        my revenge! Hahaha…!” <em>cough</em> <em>cough</em> Adelard
        was suddenly gripped by a coughing fit, but he kept
        crowing. “Dismiss me from service, will they?!
        <em>cough</em> Old and useless… am I?! I'll show them!” He
        coughed again, fighting to breathe now. “I will hex them
        and torture them until they…”</p>
        <p>He stopped cavorting and capering, and his eyes went
        wide. “Until they… until…” He clutched his chest.</p>
        <p>“Uh-oh,” the devil said, genuinely worried.</p>
        <p>“HNNG!” Adelard grunted. Then he collapsed to the
        ground, curled into a fetal position, obviously in immense
        pain.</p>
        <p>“Nono. Nurse!” the devil called out. “Doctor!? Is
        anyone… you should lie down. Well, you are lying down. Do
        some… some deep-breathing exercises. Have a cup of tea!
        That always…”</p>
        <p>Adelard gasped one last time and uncurled, muscles
        relaxed. Eyes open but unseeing.</p>
        <p>“…calms me down,” the devil said quietly.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the candles were extinguished as one, plunging
        the room into pitch-blackness. The devil's hellsight meant
        this was only a minor inconvenience for him. “Um,” he said
        to the empty room. “Uh-oh.”</p>
        <p>He poked the tip of his boot at the chalk symbol
        surrounding him on the floor. Nothing happened. He stepped
        on it. Nothing happened. He put his weight on that foot. No
        alarms went off.</p>
        <p>He walked out of the circle. Nothing happened. No one,
        it seemed, cared.</p>
        <p>A few moments later, the door to a small home, little
        more than a wooden shack on the outskirts of a small
        village, opened. A well-dressed devil peeked out and then
        slowly emerged, stepping onto the dirt road that led
        through the center of the village. A keep stood atop a hill
        in the distance.</p>
        <p>“Ah,” the devil said.</p>
        <p>A wide woman dressed in wool, carrying a pile of clean
        clothes, saw him and stopped in her tracks, her mouth
        open.</p>
        <p>“Oh! Good day to you, madam, I wonder if you could tell
        me…”</p>
        <p>“AAAHHHHH!!!” she screamed. For quite a long time. Then
        she dropped her laundry and ran.</p>
        <p>“Ah. Um. Hmm.”</p>
        <p>A young man in a low, stone building saw this exchange,
        grabbed what looked like a long iron poker, and ran out to
        confront the new arrival.</p>
        <p>“Have at you, devil!” he said, assuming something like a
        dueling pose.</p>
        <p>“I say! Steady on!” The devil raised his hands.</p>
        <p>The two of them stood there, frozen in the middle of the
        street for a few moments.</p>
        <p>Then the devil turned and ran away as quickly as he
        could.</p>
        <p>“And that's how I ended up here!” Riyalkin toasted his
        dinner companion. “Now, after years of obscurity, a
        legendary hero!”</p>
        <p>“Legendarily vain,” his dinner guest teased with a
        smile.</p>
        <p>“Simply playing my part, darling. People expect a
        certain amount of vanity in a troubadour, don't they?”</p>
        <p>She laughed. “Riyalkin the Red Pen is every bit as
        advertised.”</p>
        <p>“Thank you. And besides, accusations of vanity are a bit
        rich coming from my leading lady.”</p>
        <p>“Not all actors are vain.” She took offense beautifully.
        “Just the good ones.” She sipped her drink.</p>
        <p>“Well then, you must be very vain indeed,” the devil
        said.</p>
        <p>“Anyway, does that answer your question?”</p>
        <p>“Mostly. Do they speak Caelian in hell?”</p>
        <p>“What a good question. Unless it's very old, the ritual
        usually grants knowledge of the summoner's language. I
        gather in the bad old days, we used to just show up in a
        cloud of brimstone and gabble at people. I'm sure it was
        impressive, but what did it achieve? Not very professional,
        I can tell you that.”</p>
        <p>“No cloud of brimstone now?” she teased.</p>
        <p>He waggled his eyebrows. “Style counts for
        something.”</p>
        <p>“But wait, that was….” She did some quick mental math.
        “Fifteen years ago?”</p>
        <p>“Well, I was an accountant here in Capital for several
        years in between.”</p>
        <p>“An accountant!”</p>
        <p>Riyalkin shrugged. “It's what I did before. I'm
        moderately good at it.”</p>
        <p>“And how does one go from being an alien accountant to a
        famous troubadour?”</p>
        <p>“Well…” Riyalkin seemed uncomfortable suddenly. “It's
        just that… the thing is, accountancy in the Seven Cities is
        just so much more interesting than it is here. Plotting and
        scheming, always on the lookout for an assassin, people
        constantly trying to claw their way up the ladder, usually
        over your dead body. And I guess I just… missed the
        excitement.”</p>
        <p>“The excitement of being an accountant.”</p>
        <p>“The excitement of being an accountant in Hell,”
        Riyalkin said. “In any event, enough about me and the
        thrill of double-entry bookkeeping. Perhaps you can
        enlighten me. Why is it, in spite of my impeccable taste
        and the outrageous sums I spend looking good, I always feel
        underdressed in your presence? Do you employ sorcery? Or is
        it that any outfit is improved by your unearthly
        beauty?”</p>
        <p>She blushed in spite of herself and raised her own glass
        in a toast.</p>
        <p>“You silver-tongued devil.”</p>

      <h3>DRAGON KNIGHT</h3>
      <p>“I thought the dragon knights would save us, but even they
      couldn't stop Ajax. Now the roads aren't safe. People are
      taken from their homes without cause or warning, never to
      return. I don't know what's going to happen now, except
      everyone's afraid all the time.”</p>
      <p>“I think things are going to get a lot worse before they
      get better.”</p>
      <p>The <strong>Ritual of Dracogenesis</strong> that grants
      the power to create a generation of dragon knights—also known
      as draconians or wyrmwights—is obscure and supremely
      difficult for even an experienced sorcerer to master. Small
      populations of draconians in Khemhara, Higara, and Khorshir
      attest to this. Descendants of original generations created
      millennia ago by powerful wizards, they have never been
      numerous. A typical clutch yields only a single egg. After
      only a few generations, these draconians begin to show new
      adaptations like feathers or frilled ridges.</p>
      <p>The largest extant population of draconians is the
      remnants of the Dragon Phalanx in Vasloria. Created by Good
      King Omund's wizard Vitae, the Dragon Phalanx once numbered
      several thousand of the king's greatest knights, ensuring the
      rule of law across the land.</p>
      <p>Knighthood was a title carried by every member of that
      first generation of dragon knights. Within the Dragon Phalanx
      were shadows, censors, tacticians, and elementalists. Members
      of virtually every heroic vocation could be found in one of
      the eight dragonflights that made up the phalanx. For over
      thirty years, these heroes were symbols of justice,
      protecting the weak from the strong, and standing between the
      common folk and those who sought power over others. Those who
      grew up in that place and time could never have imagined any
      other way of life.</p>
      <p>Then Ajax came.</p>
      <section id="on-the-dragon-knights" class="level4">
        <h4>ON THE DRAGON KNIGHTS</h4>
        <p>The cloaked figure at the back of the inn stood up. As
        they did so, their hood slipped down, revealing their head
        and face. A susurration rippled through the crowd. One man
        standing near the bar dropped his jaw, followed by his
        flagon of mead.</p>
        <p>A tall, broad draconian stepped into the light. He was
        old, his scales battle-scarred. He rested one clawed hand
        on the pommel of a mace that hung from a loop on his belt,
        while the other carried his shield by a strap. His flat,
        expressionless look was more terrifying than any
        threatening glower.</p>
        <p>The three human bandits took a step back. One of the
        dwarves just sneered—then, sensing his human compatriot's
        reluctance, turned to look at them. “What's this?” the lead
        dwarf growled.</p>
        <p>“Don't be cowards now!” the other dwarf said, a hint of
        joy in his voice. “Look what a prize we have caught!”</p>
        <p>“We didn't…” one bandit said, shaking. “We didn't
        know…”</p>
        <p>Looking at the dragon knight, the other bandit added
        quickly, “We didn't know there was one of you here.”</p>
        <p>The draconian didn't move. Didn't give any indication he
        heard the man. Just stared unblinking at the lead
        dwarf.</p>
        <p>“Think of the bounty,” the dwarf hissed to the humans,
        but he kept his eye on the draconian. “We'll all be
        rich.”</p>
        <p>“I don't…” One of the bandits dropped her sword and held
        her hands up as she backed away from the group toward the
        exit. “I don't need it that bad,” she said. Then she turned
        and ran out the door. Her human compatriots followed.</p>
        <p>The two dwarves surveyed the tavern. The people were now
        all facing them. A few had stood up. They weren't afraid
        anymore.</p>
        <p>“We'll be back,” the lead dwarf said, and the two of
        them backed out of the inn, sheathing their shortswords
        before they turned and left.</p>
        <p>As one, the people in the tavern turned to look with
        undisguised awe at the dragon knight. He noticed this,
        ducked his head to avoid their gaze. “Show's over,” he
        growled, then he turned to go back to his seat in the
        rear.</p>
        <p>“Thank you,” the woman behind the bar said. “Thank you
        for…”</p>
        <p>She stopped when she saw the draconian was ignoring
        her.</p>
        <p>A short, doughty, middle-aged man stood up, and two
        equally doughty women at the same table stood up with him.
        “Excuse me, sir knight,” the man said as the dragon knight
        walked past their table.</p>
        <p>The knight moved on, ignoring them. The man reached out
        and grabbed the massive draconian's arm. The knight wheeled
        on the peasant, looming over him.</p>
        <p>The man bowed his head and touched his forelock. The two
        women with him curtseyed and tried to avoid making eye
        contact.</p>
        <p>“Begging your pardon, sir, but we been lookin' for
        you.”</p>
        <p>The dragon knight sneered and bared a set of sharp
        teeth. “Look for someone else,” he growled as he pulled his
        arm away.</p>
        <p>The man scurried around to stand in front of the
        draconian, blocking his way. He took off his worn cap and
        held it over his breast. “I'm sorry sir, but there ain't no
        one else. And there's this new tax, you see, from the new
        baron. And a priest says he's of Saint Ajax.”</p>
        <p>The knight bared his impressive teeth, ready to scare
        Jago and the other two away—when someone else spoke.</p>
        <p>“You might want to hear 'em out, Vaant,” said a voice
        from the table the three peasants had been sitting at.</p>
        <p>The dragon knight turned sharply to look at the man
        who'd spoken. His back was to the draconian, but the voice
        gave him away.</p>
        <p>“John?”</p>
        <p>The man turned to look up.</p>
        <p>“Hi Vaant,” he said, smiling. He rose from the table. He
        was middle-aged, fit. Black hair hung down to his
        shoulders. He was armed with many weapons, looked like a
        captain of the guard. “Folks,” he said, “this is
        Vaantikalisax, Knight of King Omund in the Thunder Phalanx.
        He may be the last of the Storm Knights.”</p>
        <p>The man held out his hand. The dragon knight looked at
        it for a moment before reaching out slowly to grasp it.
        “What are you doing out here?” Vaantikalisax asked.</p>
        <p>“These people need help. I said I'd find it. Heard a
        rumor someone matching your description was holed up here
        having a drinking contest with Mr. John
        Barleycorn.”</p>
        <p>The draconian sniffed, released John's hand, and looked
        at the three peasants. “Why do you people need me? You're
        in the company of Sir John, Commander of the Fifth …”</p>
        <p>“Just John,” Sir John said, holding a hand up. “The new
        baron stripped me of my title. My lands.”</p>
        <p>“I didn't know that.” The draconian's voice softened.
        “I'm sorry.”</p>
        <p>“I'll be fine. But these people…” John said, gesturing
        to the three older peasants. Vaantikalisax waved him to
        silence.</p>
        <p>“Sure,” he said. “But why me?”</p>
        <p>“Thought maybe you'd like to get back in the game.”</p>
        <p>“The game.”</p>
        <p>“Yeah.” Sir John smiled. “The hero game.”</p>
        <p>Vaantikalisax said nothing. The inn had mostly gone back
        to its business but the three peasants watched intently.
        Eventually, the dragon knight spoke again, his voice
        low.</p>
        <p>“I owe you a lot, John—but not everything.”</p>
        <p>“I'm not asking everything.”</p>
        <p>“No, that's not how it starts. But I have this feeling
        that's how it'll end.”</p>
        <p>“What does your oath say? ‘Even should the sun stop in
        the sky, even should the night—'”</p>
        <p>“John,” the dragon knight said, his voice suddenly sad.
        Exasperated. “You don't want to quote my oath to me. You
        really don't. I liked serving with you. I have fond
        memories of that time—of you. Don't spoil it.” He looked at
        his friend, the three peasants, then shook his head and
        turned to leave the inn.</p>
        <p>“Vaant,” Sir John said, following. “Sir Vaantikalisax,
        by your oath!”</p>
        <p>The dragon knight stopped and spun around. Everyone in
        the inn was watching the show again. Act two.</p>
        <p>“The people need leadership,” John said as he looked at
        all the folk watching.</p>
        <p>Vaantikalisax's reptile eyes flashed in anger. “They had
        it. Thirty years, and what did it amount to?! I watched
        Ajax… I watched him…” The dragon knight's eyes flinched.
        His clawed hands tightened on his mace and shield. “I
        watched the oath… fail.”</p>
        <p>“Vaant… Vaant, the Dragon Phalanx didn't fail. You were
        betrayed. It was Mandrake! One of your own, don't you get
        it? You're just as fallible as the rest of us. You were
        never ‘incorruptible.' It's just what we wanted to believe.
        You're just people—like the rest of us.”</p>
        <p>The dragon knight looked at the people around him, at
        the three peasants desperate for someone, anyone, to help
        them. Then he looked back to his friend.</p>
        <p>“Exactly,” Vaantikalisax said. Then he turned and left
        the inn.</p>

      <h3>DWARF</h3>
      <p>“Remember, we are dwarves. Our strength is the strength of
      the earth. The strength of the marble column that rises to
      the heavens. The strength of the granite foundation that
      reaches deep into the ground. But what is the value of
      strength if it is not used in service of justice?”</p>
      <p>—Zarok the Lawgiver, Hero, Dwarves 232</p>
      <p>Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves
      have flesh infused with stone—a silico-organic hybrid making
      them physically denser than other humanoids. They enjoy a
      reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists
      thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings,
      the long-extinct steel dwarves.</p>
      <p>Dwarves are the children of the elder god Ord, and a
      common phrase among dwarves is “Ord made the world”—their way
      of saying, “What will be, will be.” They take great pride in
      knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created
      the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see
      the world and seek glory in Ord's name.</p>
      <section id="on-dwarves" class="level4">
        <h4>ON DWARVES</h4>
        <p>There's nothing a team of dwarves can't do! Five dwarves
        alone can easily kill a dragon. Ten dragons!<a href="#fn1"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role=
        "doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Why, Vorka the Fell-Handed
        alone slew five dragons at the Siege of Var Loska before
        succumbing to her wounds. One dwarf! Think what a small,
        dedicated party of dwarves could do!</p>
        <p>There aren't many of the great dragons left, alas, so we
        must … I mean, dwarves must content themselves with
        fighting lesser evils. Necromancers, tyrants. Folks who
        cheat at dice.</p>
        <p>Dwarves take the long view. Well, so do elves, but elves
        seem more interested in preserving things. Dwarves want to
        make things! Improve the world! “The world is fine the way
        it is …” Shut up! No it's not! The world is full of pain,
        misery, injustice. We cannot make a perfect world, but we
        can strive to improve the one we've got!</p>
        <p>Anyway. Humans make too much of this so-called rivalry
        between dwarves and elves. Yes, it was an elf army that
        slew the last steel dwarves in the War Against Night, but
        that was tens of thousands of years ago. And anyway, those
        were the shadow elves, long banished to the World Below.
        And none now live who remember those days.</p>
        <p>The steel dwarves—the greatest of us—are dead now, and
        our cousins the fire dwarves left this world for
        Quintessence long ago. There they built Alloy, the City of
        Brass, the City at the Center of the Timescape. A marvel!
        Not so large as Capital, perhaps, but not so … fragrant
        either.</p>
        <p>It is left to us, the stone dwarves, the Last Children
        of Ord, to work stone, create great marvels with it. Our
        greatest days are not behind us! Who speaks thus?! Have we
        not been to the Hanging City of Kal Kalavar together? Will
        you ever forget that place? I will not should I live to be
        a thousand, and neither will you. And it was finished in my
        lifetime. Only three hundred years ago! It's brand new!</p>
        <p>Elven rivalry. Pagh! Did we not name the most precious
        metal in the earth “valiar” after their god Val? Val is a
        noble god, a worthy patron of the elves. He seeks justice
        and glory in his own way, we deem. Were one to choose the
        path of the conduit, you could pick worse gods than Val to
        serve.</p>
        <p>It is the humans who make so much of rivalries between
        the ancestries. It was the humans who called us “dwarves.”
        We do not know the significance of this word in their
        tongue, but we accept it. Their speech is crude, true, but
        they are a young species after all. We must not judge them
        too harshly. “Elemental” would be a faithful translation of
        our word for ourselves into the Caelian tongue.</p>
        <p>Ah, the record of dwarven achievement is long … too long
        to tell in so short a space. And it is not seemly to
        compare ourselves so. This entry spends many words on elves
        and men as though we were competitors, but who says it? Why
        should it be thus? Was it a dwarf who slew Baalorak the
        Griefbringer? No! It was the Crown of Nine Stars! That
        legendary company of heroes who counted three dwarves among
        their number, but also elves and orcs and humans. Like the
        great cosmopolitan city of Alloy, we are stronger
        together.</p>
        <p>Look you again at the Hanging City. Yes, your eyes well
        with tears from the magnificence of it, but see it clearly.
        Is it a dwarven city? Everyone calls it thus, but do you
        know how many humans live there? Thousands. And orcs. And
        elves! Of course! How else should it be?</p>
        <p>Some say the greatest ages of the world are behind us,
        but this is not so. Not so. While there is yet will in the
        world, there is greatness. You will see. The elves, the
        orcs. Humans and dwarves. All the speaking peoples have
        wonder in them yet. Our greatest days are ahead. Did not
        Ord make the world?</p>
        <p>None of us ask to come into this world, and apart from
        the Hakaan, none of us know how we will leave it. But
        remember, you are a dwarf. You have it in you to work
        marvels. To change the world, be you a holy conduit of
        Valak-koth the Peacebringer, one of the talented Mind
        Masters of the White Gem, a beastheart of the Darkdivers
        seeking through the World Below for deep knowledge, or a
        master tactician of the Imperial War College in Capital.
        You will make a better world.</p>
        <p>You are young yet, but already those who work evil deeds
        should fear you. You are a dwarf. You have a great destiny
        ahead.</p>

      <h3>ELF, WODE</h3>
      <p>See you the wood so dark and deep, Where runs the fox and
      hare? You know now why your mother weeps. Your father's bones
      lie there.</p>
      <p>See you the river clear and sweet So beautiful and fair?
      Follow it in and you may meet The Queen of Dark and Air.</p>
      <p>Children of the sylvan celestials and masters of the
      elf-haunted forests called wodes, wode elves see all forests
      as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their
      reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too
      far into the woods. Humans should fear the trees.</p>
      <p>The wode elves' natural ability to mask their presence,
      called glamor, complements their guerilla style of fighting,
      letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back
      into the underbrush. These traits also make the relatively
      few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban
      warfare.</p>
      <section id="on-wode-elves" class="level4">
        <h4>ON WODE ELVES</h4>
        <p>“I'm scared,” Wenna said. “We should go back.” The
        forest felt as if it was closing in on them.</p>
        <p>“We're not going back,” Jeremy said. Normally, such a
        statement would be the end of the discussion, but they were
        alone and far from home.</p>
        <p>“What if we're going in circles?”</p>
        <p>“Then we keep going in circles!” Dade said from
        somewhere up ahead. “Until we find the elves.”</p>
        <p>“The elves have found you!” a clear, bright voice called
        out. The children froze. They scanned the wood, but there
        were no signs of the speaker.</p>
        <p>Then, only a few feet from them, a half-dozen figures
        melded out of the background, as if the trees and bushes
        and grass had been painted on them to perfectly match the
        wode. They wore light armor covered in leaves, moss, and
        vines, and they bristled with weapons.</p>
        <p>“Black gods!” Meliora gasped. Credan frowned, and Wenna
        hushed her for swearing. Dade was ushered back toward them
        by two more wode elves, his bow in hand. The children
        huddled together, Credan's hand on the symbol of Saint
        Gryffyn around his neck, and Jeremy's hand on the hilt of
        his sword.</p>
        <p>The elves were tall, taller than an adult human, but
        seemed always to crouch as soon as they stopped moving.
        Their eyes were unsettling, widely spaced and huge. But it
        was their ears, long and tall and twisting and set with
        great scoops to catch all sound, that marked them as elves
        of the wode.</p>
        <p>“Admittedly, though, most terrans regret the
        experience.”</p>
        <p>The voice they had heard called out again—from above.
        The children looked up and now saw a wode elf with long,
        furry, twisting ears and nut-brown skin smiling down at
        them. They were wearing a brightly colored outfit. The
        children watched the elf leap lightly from branch to lower
        branch until finally landing with a flourish on the forest
        floor before them.</p>
        <p>“Consort!” An elf before them spoke in Yllyric as he
        stood from his crouch and bowed. “We have been tracking
        these since they entered the wode.”</p>
        <p>Meliora, who understood the words, whispered to the
        others. “They called that one ‘consort!'”</p>
        <p>Llyander smiled, looking from Meliora to the elf who had
        just addressed them with a <strong>See? I told
        you!</strong> look on their face.</p>
        <p>The tall, swashbuckling elf bowed to the children. “I am
        Llyander, the Lightning Strike, Consort to Queen Imyrr.”
        They indicated the elf who had spoken. “This is my cousin,
        Rhythylthin.”</p>
        <p>“How did you know we were here?” Jeremy asked. Dade
        stood just behind him, with an arrow now nocked.</p>
        <p>The one called Rhythylthin reached out while Dade was
        turned, looking at the queen's consort, and deftly plucked
        the arrow from the young man's bow.</p>
        <p>“Nothing happens within the wode without our knowledge,”
        the elf said. Dade spun on him and nocked another arrow.
        “And approval,” Rhythylthin added, closing his hand and
        snapping the arrow in it.</p>
        <p>“You come bearing a gift for our queen—the Codex
        Dryadalis.” Llyander nodded at the heavy scroll Meliora
        carried. “My cousin Rhythylthin here was sent to capture
        you and escort you to the Orchid Court. But I am the
        queen's consort, and have my own thoughts on the
        matter.”</p>
        <p>The elf smiled at the children. “But have no fear,” they
        said. Their Vaslorian was perfect, their voice a song. “You
        are safe … now.” The pause before “now” spoke volumes.</p>
        <p>“Are you a … a … boy or a girl?” Wenna asked.</p>
        <p>Llyander smiled gaily. “I am a song! I contain melodies
        and harmonies alike,” they said. Wenna smiled.</p>
        <p>Rhythylthin rolled his eyes. Llyander noticed this and
        winked at him. “Fashions change. My cousin here wears the
        new trends.” They gestured at the other wode elf's garb and
        masculine appearance. “Me? I'm old-fashioned.” They
        gestured to their own outfit and appearance. “Grace never
        goes out of style.”</p>
        <p>Llyander turned to Rhythylthin and the rest of the wode
        elf band. “Their gift goes to Lord Tear, methinks. I will
        escort them.” Then, suddenly imperious, they added, “You
        may go.”</p>
        <p>In spite of his previous skepticism toward the queen's
        consort, Rhythylthin straightened and bowed. As one, the
        elves turned and flowed into the wode. In only a few steps,
        they melded into the trees and undergrowth.</p>
        <p>“How did they do that?” Meliora demanded, spinning to
        confront their benefactor.</p>
        <p>“Hmm? Do what?” Llyander asked, looking after the elves,
        wondering what Meliora meant.</p>
        <p>“Just … disappear like that!”</p>
        <p>Llyander looked at the other children with a combination
        of wonder and annoyance. “Do terran children not play
        hiding games?”</p>
        <p>“Well …” Jeremy looked at Dade, who was no help. “We do,
        but …”</p>
        <p>Llyander made a theatrical, dismissive gesture with one
        arm. “Well, it is the same thing, then. But for our people,
        it is a game we practice all our lives! We would be poor
        protectors of the wode if we could not conceal ourselves
        within it.”</p>
        <p>“But that was …” Meliora was frustrated at the elf's
        seeming evasion. “That was magic!”</p>
        <p>“You say? Well,” Llyander mused, “terrans are a part and
        apart, it is said. It is your blessing and your curse
        methinks. Perhaps someday you can explain it to me!” The
        elf's eyes twinkled at Meliora's frustration.</p>
        <p>Llyander turned and marched off. “Come!” they called.
        The children ran to catch up.</p>
        <p>“Where are we going?” Wenna asked.</p>
        <p>“I enjoy the favor of Lord Tear,” Llyander said. “We are
        old friends. With me as your guide, he will treat you
        well—likely bestow favor upon you! You should be in
        anticipation of great treasure.” They smiled.</p>
        <p>The elf stopped suddenly and spun toward them, serious
        but kindly. They pointed to each of the children in
        turn.</p>
        <p>“I will instruct you on the proper etiquette, but
        remember this: Lord Tear will test us. Some tests for you
        and some for me. The high elves and the wode elves are but
        distant cousins. You will hear much that is polite, much
        that is flattering, but it is all another kind of glamor.
        It hides deep tensions, recently exacerbated by the treaty
        with Ajax.”</p>
        <p>The children nodded. The elf, satisfied, marched off and
        they followed.</p>
        <p>Jeremy turned to Dade. “I feel like we're in a dream,”
        he whispered.</p>
        <p>“You are!” their escort called out. “The wode is a
        dream! With a little luck, one you may soon wake safely
        from.”</p>

      <h3>ELF, HIGH</h3>
      <p>“Ajax has a kind of crude style, perhaps, but no taste. I
      have no objection to a villain, you understand. The world is
      a tale, but a tale is only as good as its villain. And Ajax
      is so … artless. We deserve a better villain.”</p>
      <p>Children of the solar celestials created to tend their
      libraries and attend to the true elves as heralds, the high
      elves remember a better age, before the coming of humans and
      war. A time when the celestials were still in the world, and
      all that mattered was art and beauty.</p>
      <p>In the millennia since their creators retired to Arcadia,
      the high elves built a civilization for themselves, primarily
      living in and among the fallen celestial sky cities. With no
      creators left to please, the elves continue as they did
      before—collecting lore and knowledge, worshiping art, and
      turning more inward and distrusting of outsiders with each
      generation.</p>
      <section id="on-high-elves" class="level4">
        <h4>ON HIGH ELVES</h4>
        <p>“They're so beautiful,” Wenna said. “It's hard to
        imagine we're in danger.”</p>
        <p>“It's not that hard,” Dade said darkly.</p>
        <p>The five children stood alone in the center of a large
        circular courtyard open to the sky, their wode elf escort
        Llyander at their side. Lord Tear, King of the High Elves,
        sat on a marble throne, holding the scroll of the Codex
        Dryadalis in his lap. He had not spoken since Llyander made
        their speech and handed the codex over. The members of the
        court, nobles and courtiers and learned sages, gathered to
        watch. Implacable warriors in golden plate with fine
        filigree etched into the metal stood guard around the
        perimeter. They bristled with weapons.</p>
        <p>“They seem like …” Meliora said, searching for the
        words.</p>
        <p>“Like the lords of all the world,” Wenna said with awe
        and wonder.</p>
        <p>“And we are their prisoners,” Jeremy said, looking at
        his brother Dade and Credan beside him.</p>
        <p>“You're not prisoners,” Llyander said quietly. “You are
        guests. You're safer here than you would be even in your
        own homes.”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” Jeremy said, looking at the nearest guards with
        their longspears and swords. “We feel very safe.”</p>
        <p>“Who are you kidding?” Dade said. “Everyone knows how
        much elves hate humans.”</p>
        <p>At this, Lord Tear exchanged a look with Llyander,
        consort to Queen Imyrr. It was a knowing look, full of
        sadness and melancholy. Then he broke his silence.</p>
        <p>“Show me an elf who hates humans,” he said, his voice
        deep and sonorous, “and I will show you an elf who loved a
        human and watched them grow old and die.” He looked at the
        children for the first time and smiled a melancholy smile.
        “Love is like sunlight for us, you see. We love completely
        but rarely. The loss of it means an eternity of grief for
        us.”</p>
        <p>The king tapped the scroll against his lap, seeming to
        have reached a decision.</p>
        <p>“Well done, consort. Young humans, your escort here
        seeks to shame me. For they know well they could have taken
        this prize to their queen and earned her favor. Instead,
        Llyander brought it to me in the hopes that by doing so,
        they deliver me the power necessary to throw off the yoke
        of Ajax's rule. Long has Llyander resented the decision I
        made and sought to change it …” He looked at Llyander. “…
        by changing my mind.”</p>
        <p>Llyander nodded deferentially, silently congratulating
        the king on his insight.</p>
        <p>“Alas, your escort's efforts are for naught.” Then the
        king's face became softer. He held up the heavy scroll.
        “But this is not nothing,” he said. “We made a treaty with
        Ajax to deliver unto him any artifacts our search teams
        discover from the ruins of this city. He benefits from this
        bargain more than we. But this, methinks, will stay with
        us. It was written by my mother in the youth of the world,
        and there are some things which must be denied the Iron
        Saint, even should they violate the treaty.”</p>
        <p>Llyander turned to the children and smiled brilliantly,
        eyebrows waggling in a show of glee. Wenna and Credan
        couldn't help but smile. “Well, you see, children?”
        Llyander said. “We only have more to do, not everything to
        do.”</p>
        <p>The king stood up and a herald beside the throne
        announced, “Gather ye, and attend! The Lord of Fallen
        Irranys, Morning Dew On a Single Leaf Like a Tear from the
        Sun, speaks. And know his word is law!”</p>
        <p>Lord Tear glided down the steps until he was standing,
        as tall as Llyander, before the children. His face was
        noble and beautiful. Wisps of silver-like strands of smoke
        spread across his golden skin. He seemed at once eternal
        and youthful.</p>
        <p>“You have heard many things about my people, but this
        above all you should know. We do not value lore for lore's
        sake, but beauty first and above all other things. And the
        truth, to us, is a kind of beauty. Thus do we find
        knowledge beautiful.</p>
        <p>“You have returned something not only of enormous
        worldpower, but at the same time, a work of art my mother
        labored over for many of your centuries. It is something of
        a miracle that it is returned to me now. I will not forget
        this. You have made an ally of the lord of the high elves.
        And though you lead brief lives, while you live, you shall
        have the favor of the elves.” He turned to hand the scroll
        over to a sage and confer with his herald.</p>
        <p>“He seems wise,” Credan said.</p>
        <p>“And smart,” Meliora said.</p>
        <p>“I'm surprised how kind he is,” Jeremy said. “He seems a
        good king.”</p>
        <p>Llyander chuckled. Wenna noticed. She didn't say
        anything at first, but eventually, she couldn't resist.
        “What?”</p>
        <p>Llyander raised an eyebrow, then walked in front of the
        children so that as the wode elf spoke, their back was to
        the king.</p>
        <p>“Do you remember when my cousin's soldiers hid in the
        wode?” they said, their voice low. “How astonished you
        were?”</p>
        <p>Wenna and Meliora nodded. Llyander nodded to the guards
        and guests. “This is their glamor. Whatever you find
        pleasant and attractive in another? That is what you see in
        them. If you value good humor, they are jesters. If you
        value beauty, they are breathtaking. If you find
        intelligence attractive, they are sages. It is not just an
        effect of appearance, though it is also that. It is one of
        demeanor.”</p>
        <p>“But how do they do …” Meliora started.</p>
        <p>Llyander put a finger to their lips, silencing young
        Meliora. “It is not a thing they do. It is an effect in
        your mind.”</p>
        <p>“You mean they don't even know they're doing it?”
        Meliora asked.</p>
        <p>“Then what do they really look like?” Wenna asked.</p>
        <p>Llyander shrugged. “What does anyone really look like?”
        And while the other children chalked this up to their
        escort's normally abstruse mode of communication, Meliora
        caught a glimpse of understanding somewhere in her
        mind.</p>
        <p>The king turned back to them. “Should any of you seek
        hidden lore or deep wisdom, please allow me to serve you
        first. But you, young woman, the human child who learned
        our language, I name thee elf friend. And my naming carries
        power. You will find the learning of our lore will come
        more quickly to you, and all those who still revere the
        elves will give you safe passage in their lands.”</p>
        <p>Llyander put their hands on their hips and regarded the
        children. “Not bad for your second quest. What shall you do
        for an encore?”</p>

      <h3>HAKAAN</h3>
      <p>“COME FORTH, SONS OF ORD!” the hakaan metamorph bellowed
      as Ajax's dwarven legion advanced. “AND MEET A BETTER WOMAN
      THAN THEE!!”</p>
      <p>In spite of their friendly, outgoing nature, the rare
      presence of a hakaan in human society is considered a
      harbinger—an omen of dark times.</p>
      <p>Descended from a tribe of giants in upper Vanigar, the
      original Haka'an tribe made a bargain with Holkatja, the
      Vanigar trickster god. They traded some of their gigantic
      size and strength for the ability to see the future.</p>
      <p>But Holkatja betrayed them, and the only future they are
      allowed to see is the moment and nature of their own death.
      These visions are never of some mundane tragedy. No hakaan
      ever received a vision of dying from choking on a grape. The
      doomsight is always momentous—always dramatic.</p>
      <p>This doomsight can happen at any moment. It does not come
      for all or even most hakaan, but when it comes, it is
      considered an act of overwhelming hubris to ignore it. Trying
      to escape the doomsight means a painful, tragic death, and
      cursing your family to live with shame.</p>
      <p>For this reason, the only hakaan the average human meets
      is one trying to fulfill their doom. The human
      superstition—that the arrival of one or more hakaan in human
      lands is a sign of great forces acting in the world,
      auspicious times—is literally true. In dark times, many
      hakaan experience the doomsight and leave their communities
      to venture out into the mundane world, in search of their
      destiny.</p>
      <p>Humans in Vanigar have their own word for this concept of
      a personal fate, “wyrd.” Traditional hakaan sometimes refer
      to the doomsight as wyrdken.</p>
      <section id="on-hakaan" class="level4">
        <h4>ON HAKAAN</h4>
        <p>“You … you know when you're going to die?”</p>
        <p>The Pillar, dressed in her civilian clothing—a simple
        pleated dress cinched at the waist that left her bare arms
        free to work—dipped her hand in the pail of water. It
        immediately sprang to life, the water sizzled and danced as
        her fingers cooled. She pulled her hand out, shook off the
        water, and went back to sculpting the granite.</p>
        <p>The hard, tough stone melded like clay under her
        fingers. Whatever she was doing, it generated enormous heat
        in her fingertips, hence the pails of water beside her. The
        Arrow couldn't tell if this was her talent manifest, or
        something her people could do, or neither. As he watched,
        he realized he recognized the bust. It was the girl they
        rescued during the Society's recent battle with the
        Academy.</p>
        <p>“Not exactly,” the Pillar said as she concentrated on
        her art. “Not when. More sort of …” She looked away from
        her sculpture and looked out the window, thinking. “How.
        Why. I am told there is a sense of …” she looked at the
        young man, a teenager, only recently recruited to the
        Society. “Anticipation. Eagerness when the time is nigh.
        So,” she took in a deep breath, which was an impressive
        sight to see in a 9-foot-tall woman, and let it out,
        smiling at the young man. “Not anytime soon.” Her smile was
        like a sunrise.</p>
        <p>Though he had lived with fear most of his young life,
        mortality was not something that plagued the Arrow's mind.
        He had a hard time grasping it. “That must be … awful.”</p>
        <p>“Oh no,” she went back to her work. “No it's … I do not
        know how to say it in Caelian. It is a blessing. I have
        seen people die for no reason. Be taken from their loved
        ones without warning, without … without purpose. There are
        unjust deaths. They destroy families. Communities.</p>
        <p>“But the doomsight only comes in time of great need.
        People forget Holkatja is also the goddess of luck, and
        those who beat luck—under … underdogs, as you say. She gave
        more than she stole, I sometimes think.</p>
        <p>“I do not know how long I have. No one does, but I know
        my death will have meaning. I know it, do you understand? I
        know it like I know my own name. Often I feel …” Her great
        hands clenched and unclenched, as though she were trying to
        grasp something just out of reach. “I yearn for it. I want
        it to happen. What greater end can there be than fulfilling
        one's destiny?” She looked at the mostly-finished
        sculpture. “It gives everything I do a sense of purpose.”
        She went back to work.</p>
        <p>“My people are a serene and peaceful lot. We do not seek
        glory like the folk of Vanigar. But, in battle sometimes,
        knowing I am getting closer to my wyrd, my destiny, I think
        I know how they feel. Something comes over me, some
        enormous sense of … of rightness.” She smiled again at the
        young man. “It scares my friends sometimes, I know.”</p>
        <p>The Arrow had seen it, and enthusiastically agreed.</p>
        <p>“You're not from the Barrow Hills,” he said.</p>
        <p>The Pillar shook her head. “No, I do not wot of your
        hills. I am from the hills north of the Blue Cloud
        Mountains in far Vanigar.” She turned and looked down at
        the Arrow with some pride. “My people are descended from
        the original Haka'an tribe.” She went back to work. “Though
        I am sure the Barrow Men, as you call them, are a fine
        people. We're all related, you see.”</p>
        <p>“Is that why you joined the Society?”</p>
        <p>“Oh yes,” the Pillar said. “I had only left home a
        fortnight previous when Memory came to Vanigar to recruit
        me. I had a sense my wyrd lay in some distant land, but I
        did not know the world was so big.”</p>
        <p>“Did she look like herself?” the Arrow asked, smiling,
        enjoying a moment of shared experience with the giant
        woman.</p>
        <p>The Pillar chuckled, and the Arrow's chest vibrated with
        the force of it. “No, she looked like an agéd wise woman of
        Vanigar. I think only in fabled Alloy could the Memory of a
        Sunset at Dawn walk the streets without ‘scaring the
        horses,' as they say.”</p>
        <p>“Alloy?”</p>
        <p>The Pillar looked at the Arrow out of the corner of her
        eye. “You'll see,” she said with some glee.</p>
        <p>“You were following your vision, you said.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, my wyrd as the Vanigair call it.”</p>
        <p>“What did you see?”</p>
        <p>“Oh,” she smiled and blushed, “it is not meet to
        say.”</p>
        <p>“It's bad luck?”</p>
        <p>“Mmmm … you would say maybe. I think … rude is closer,
        but the doomsight is rarely clear in any event. It is full
        of symbolism and metaphor. My father is the shaa'er of our
        tribe. The skald as the Vanigair call it. He thought the
        symbolism was a kind of protection. So that I might know
        with certainty the meaning, but be unable to clearly convey
        it to others.” She nodded. “I think he is right.”</p>
        <p>“Is it like a dream or a nightmare?” The Arrow wasn't
        sure how much it was okay to ask.</p>
        <p>“No, it was not a dream, it was a thing that happened.”
        She turned to face the Arrow and leaned her massive arms on
        her legs. “I know not how it is for other doomseekers, but
        this is how it was for me. I was collecting flecks of
        jasper, a … a mineral we add to our food. I was picking
        flakes of rock up off the ground when I saw a bee that
        could not fly and a horde of ants all around, one with
        wings. In that moment, that was all that I could see. It
        was like the rest of the world fell away, and the bee and
        the ants filled my sight. Though the bee was surrounded and
        the ants seemed to go on forever, I could see the ants were
        afraid. There were dozens of dead ants on the ground.”</p>
        <p>“What did you do?”</p>
        <p>“Mm?” The Pillar was lost for a moment, remembering the
        moment.</p>
        <p>“What happened next?”</p>
        <p>The Pillar shrugged, giant muscles in her shoulders
        rippling. “That was the end of my vision. At that moment, I
        knew I had to leave home.”</p>
        <p>“Wow.”</p>
        <p>“Indeed. Its meaning is clear to me. I stand alone
        against the endless horde. In my heart, they are Ajax's war
        dogs. I think I know this, but …” She shrugged again.</p>
        <p>“But how come you're alone? Where am I? Where's the
        Society?”</p>
        <p>“Who knows?” she smiled. “When the vision comes upon
        you, it is all you can see. Maybe it is like a painting,
        and I am the painter. And if only I could turn my head a
        little ways to the left or right, I would see my friends
        there, fighting with me. I like to think mine is a great
        sacrifice, made so my friends can escape some overwhelming
        evil. It is a common theme among the fated I am told.”</p>
        <p>“What about the bee? What happened to the bee?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, feeling sorry for it, I placed my finger gently on
        the ground, and you must see,” she held up her pinky, “even
        my little finger is like a mighty wall for the bee. I
        sought only to protect it from the ants, but it quickly
        scrambled onto my finger, and after I stood up, it cleaned
        itself and flew away.”</p>
        <p>“It could fly!” the Arrow said, suddenly full of
        youthful exuberance. “It could fly the entire time! It was
        just waiting … for someone else to come along.”</p>
        <p>The Arrow stared, wide-eyed at the Pillar. Even before
        the young man spoke, the hakaan talent's eyes widened in
        realization. “My vision …” she said.</p>
        <p>“Wasn't over!” the Arrow said, his joy impossible to
        hide.</p>

        <h4>HAKAAN BENEFITS</h4>
        <p>As a hakaan character, your size is 1L, and you have the
        following benefits:</p>
        <section id="doomsight" class="level5">
          <h5>DOOMSIGHT</h5>
          <p>Working with your Director, you can predetermine an
          encounter in which you will die. When that encounter
          begins, you become doomed. While doomed, you lose the
          Undaunted benefit from this ancestry, you automatically
          get tier 3 results on tests and resistance rolls, and you
          don't die no matter how low your Stamina falls. You then
          die immediately at the end of the encounter.</p>
          <p>If you don't predetermine your death encounter, you
          can choose to become doomed while you are dying with the
          director's approval (no action required). Doing so should
          be reserved for encounters in which you are dying as a
          result of suitable heroism, such as making a last stand
          against a boss or saving civilians, or when the
          consequences of your actions have finally caught up to
          you—not because you're playing a one-shot and have
          nothing to lose, Hacaarl.</p>

          <h5>UNDAUNTED</h5>
          <p>You can't be weakened. Additionally, when your Stamina

          rubble instead of dying. You are unaware of your

      <h3>HUMAN</h3>
      <p>“Humans,” the dwarf said with a combination of
      exasperation and awe. “Their only virtue seems to be
      believing in impossible things.”</p>
      <p>“Humans belong to the world in a way the other speaking
      peoples do not. You can sense the presence of magic—that…
      oily smell in the air, as I've heard it described. And the
      presence of deathless causes the hairs on the back of your
      neck to stand up. Or why do you think graveyards affect you
      so? Whatever magic is, its grip on you is light. Whatever
      drives the deathless, your nature rebels against it.</p>
      <p>“No one knows why this should be. We elves have no such
      senses. Nor do the elementals or the kanin … the dwarves and
      the orcs as you say. What is it that sets humans apart? I am
      an historian, not a physician. I cannot say. Perhaps some of
      you will one day find out and teach us all the reason.”</p>
      <section id="on-humans" class="level4">
        <h4>ON HUMANS</h4>
        <p>So, we arrive here at the end of your first semester of
        Human Culture. I hope to see you next year in the Caelian
        Empire course, and though it may be hard to believe now, I
        often see former students' names in our textbooks years
        later. Perhaps that will be some of you.</p>
        <p>I will now answer the one question I am asked most
        often, and which I save answering until the last day of
        class: What do I think of humans?</p>
        <p>I am a high elf, as you deem it in your tongue. A child
        of the solar celestials. And I have taught this class,
        mostly to young humans, since the Caelian emperors founded
        this city. I was asked to join the faculty by the first
        chancellor. I have seen generations of your people come
        through this classroom, and that alone would well qualify
        me to answer this question.</p>
        <p>What do I think of humans? Well, I will tell you.</p>
        <p>I was here, teaching this class during the fire of
        Enlightenment 373. The fire leveled this city. Can you
        imagine that? Can you imagine the heat, the death,
        destruction that such a thing causes?</p>
        <p>Six months after the Great Fire, your ancestors had
        rebuilt… everything. I have seen many miracles in my life.
        Witnessing that feat might be chief among them.</p>
        <p>Liches are almost always humans. Did you know that? I
        think I know why. Your lives are so short—almost as soon as
        you're born, you're thinking about dying, and you refuse to
        yield.</p>
        <p>That refusal to yield to death… to death… is what drives
        you, I think. Drives you to leave the world better than you
        found it. Causes ruined people to rebuild great city.</p>
        <p>We studied human history in this room. Did you feel that
        those great ancestors of yours were perhaps made of finer
        stuff than you? Do not think thus. I knew them, and I know
        you, and your future is greater. I sometimes think each
        human generation greater than the last—more courageous,
        more generous. Quicker to forgive.</p>
        <p>Today, Ajax's name is on everyone's tongue, but I have
        seen many great evils arise in the world. I was teaching in
        this classroom when the Pharaoh Khorsekef, desperate, his
        power failing, opened the Great Tet and drank of the time
        stored there, becoming the Ultralich. He was defeated, and
        now rules the Necropolitan Ruin in the Abyssal Waste.</p>
        <p>I was alive, though not yet a professor, when Cthrion
        Uroniziir tried to reduce the timescape into one singular
        universe, wiping out reality as we know it. She was
        defeated, and we see her cage every day.</p>
        <p>Each of these great evils was defeated by a coalition.
        The armies and heroes of many speaking peoples. And all of
        them—all of them—were led… by humans. That's a fact. That's
        history. You can look it up.</p>
        <p>Is there some rare trait that makes you uniquely
        qualified to lead disparate peoples, bring them together to
        achieve great things? I think… there must be.</p>
        <p>Those great humans, your ancestors, did not focus on
        differences. They did not weigh different people and grade
        them based on arbitrary traits deemed virtues and flaws.
        That is what Ajax does. No, those humans focused on the
        future. On making a better world… for all of us. A world
        many of them knew they would not live to see. That is a
        sacrifice… I can scarcely imagine.</p>
        <p>The people who stand against Ajax and tyrants like him
        will be just like you—normal people. Priests and scholars
        and merchants and farmers. Maybe even teachers.</p>
        <p>Stopping Ajax will require you to become something else.
        You must become heroes. Conduits of saints, warmasters of
        great armies. Censors and shadows. That may seem unlikely
        now, but the future has a way of surprising us.</p>
        <p>Some of your names, I will see written in future
        textbooks.</p>
        <p>But some of your names, I will see written in the
        stars.</p>
        <p>(Professor Cilliarwn did not elaborate on this.)</p>

      <h3>MEMONEK</h3>
      <p>“This world of yours. Ships of wood and swords of steel.
      It's so … primitive. Like a fairy tale.”</p>
      <p>“Where do you come from, lady, that our world seems a
      fable? You have no ships and swords?”</p>
      <p>“We have them.” Lady Urusistra cast a hand across the sky.
      “You see those stars? That is my home—the timescape. Our
      ships are great star freighters that ply the space lanes. And
      among those stars, light hits as hard as steel.”</p>
      <p>The native denizens of Axiom, the Plane of Uttermost Law,
      memonek dwell in a land with lakes and trees and birds and
      flowers. But on this alien world, the lakes are seas of
      mercury, the birds glitter with wings of glass stretched
      gossamer thin, and the flowers' petals are iridescent metal
      as flexible and fragile as any earthly rose.</p>
      <p>The minds of memonek are highly ordered. Their reason is
      their great pride. But when descending to the lower planes,
      including a manifold like Orden where law and chaos mix, a
      sickness comes over them—an uncontrollable sensation called …
      emotion.</p>
      <section id="on-memonek" class="level4">
        <h4>ON MEMONEK</h4>
        <p>“You want to tell me what just happened?” Sir John
        asked.</p>
        <p>Count Revile avoided his gaze, then turned and stamped
        away across the bloody battlefield.</p>
        <p>“I'm fine!” Revile shouted, all evidence to the
        contrary.</p>
        <p>“I know what I saw,” John said as he followed his
        friend. “You went into a bloodlust. And it's not the first
        time. Whether you like it or not, whether I like it or not,
        I'm in charge of this mission. Either you tell me what's
        going on, or I have no choice. I have to conclude you're a
        danger to the team and cut you loose.”</p>
        <p>Revile stopped and turned to look at the rest of the
        party, recovering from their wounds. The memonek's white
        porcelain chest heaved as he tried to calm himself. His
        ceramic skin looked as strong as plate, but John knew it
        was brittle, fragile.</p>
        <p>Count Revile took a deep breath. “We call it
        velloparatha,” he said. “In your tongue it would be …
        world-sick … or world-sickness? It is a thing that happens
        … to my people … when they come to your world. It is an
        illness of … of feeling. Emotion.”</p>
        <p>“Are you going mad?” John asked in a whisper.</p>
        <p>The memonek smiled ruefully. “It feels that way
        sometimes. I spent an hour this morning staring at an
        insect that landed on my finger—a grasshopper, the polder
        called it. I thought I had never seen a thing so perfect
        and beautiful. That was awe. As powerful as I have ever
        felt. In the battle today, anger—just as powerful.</p>
        <p>“I thought I could resist it. When I arrived here and
        felt no different, I thought perhaps world-sickness was a
        legend. But it is a slow process, this illness, these
        insidious emotions.”</p>
        <p>“No emotions where you're from?”</p>
        <p>Count Revile shook his head. “Not like this. We are
        creatures of reason, we of Axiom. It is our art, our
        pride—our religion sometimes, methinks. We have emotions.
        Joy, sadness, wonder, grief. Love. But they are… a fashion.
        They do not happen to us. They are something we indulge in,
        out of propriety. Here… everything is order and chaos
        mixed—even in me. In me.” Revile placed his hand on his
        chest.</p>
        <p>“In the battle today,” he said. “That anger was not
        directed at Ajax's War Dogs. It was directed at
        myself.”</p>
        <p>“At yourself? Why? What did you—”</p>
        <p>“John,” the memonek said, and now it was his turn to
        whisper. “I was afraid. Afraid of … of being wounded, of
        failing you, failing my friends … of dying. And out of that
        fear came … enormous anger—at myself. Anger that I was so
        weak, so … useless. Anger so … strong, so powerful … I
        forgot who I was.”</p>
        <p>John chuckled. “That's just …” He smiled broadly.
        “That's normal, man. That's just normal. We all feel that
        way.”</p>
        <p>“What? No, you don't understand—”</p>
        <p>“Oh, I don't understand? Okay, let me guess—it felt like
        you were gonna piss yourself.”</p>
        <p>“Yes!”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, happens to all of us.”</p>
        <p>“Even you?!”</p>
        <p>Sir John shrugged. “Are you kidding? Sure. But it
        doesn't help. You still got a job to do. In fact, I'd say
        that is the job. Anyone can learn the blade.” He placed his
        hand on the pommel of his sword. “Nothing special about
        that. It's learning to deal with the fear. That's the
        job—what separates the professionals from the
        amateurs.”</p>
        <p>Count Revile said nothing, just thinking.</p>
        <p>“Feeling better?”</p>
        <p>Revile nodded. “I always recover afterward, but these
        outbursts come unbidden, like thunder from a clear
        sky.”</p>
        <p>“Hmm. Yeah. Well, that explains what happened when you
        met Embers.”</p>
        <p>Count Revile did not like being reminded of that. He
        looked to the sky and shook his head. “I made a fool of
        myself.”</p>
        <p>“Don't be so hard on yourself. If you're trying to
        seduce our void mage, you made a good start of it. She's
        three thousand years old, I've known her since I was
        fifteen. I don't think I've ever seen her blush. Anyway,
        now that I know what's going on, now that I know you're
        basically a giant teenager with overactive glands, I can
        relax a little.”</p>
        <p>Sir John and Count Revile, both tacticians, stood
        together on the bloody battlefield, looking at each
        other.</p>
        <p>“John, I fear this may get worse before it gets
        better.”</p>
        <p>“So, just like everything else?” He clapped the memonek
        on the shoulder. “Don't worry, we'll help you get through
        it. I'll let the others know. Once they understand, they'll
        help too. They'll probably just take the piss out of you.
        That'll help, you'll love that.”</p>
        <p>“You're a good friend, John.”</p>
        <p>“Heh. Is that you, or the world-sickness talking?”</p>
        <p>“Me, I think. The world-sickness would have me say …
        you're a bastardly son of a bitch. But you're my bastardly
        son of a bitch.” Count Revile smiled.</p>
        <p>John laughed and put his arm around his friend as they
        headed back to the party. “Funny. The world-sickness sounds
        a lot like me.”</p>

      <h3>ORC</h3>
      <p>“Even should an arrow pierce their heart, each kanin
      warrior has within them one last act of revenge.”</p>
      <p>An anger that cannot be hidden. A fury that drives them in
      battle. Orcs are famed throughout the world as consummate
      warriors—a reputation that the peace-loving orcs find
      distasteful.</p>
      <p>The fifth of the speaking peoples, orcs arrived on Orden
      after humans and elves. They made their homes in the
      borderlands between those two cultures, preferring the
      natural forests and avoiding the elf-haunted wodes. For
      generations, this put them directly in the path of humans who
      cut down the trees and built roads and farms.</p>
      <p>Each orc has within them a fire that causes their veins to
      glow once blood is drawn. This anger propels them right to
      the edge of death. The dichotomy between their desire to be
      left alone and their zeal in battle is summarized in a
      dwarven proverb:</p>
      <p>“Be thankful orcs do not hold grudges.”</p>

        <h4>ON ORCS</h4>
        <p>What a world we have made.</p>
        <p>Indeed, what a marvel!</p>
        <p>It is a marvel now, with the dragons and celestials,
        elementals and terrans.</p>
        <p>It is unseemly. It was better before things started
        talking.</p>
        <p>And having opinions. About our creation. About us!</p>
        <p>Oh, I don't know. I thought I agreed, but then look you
        what our sibling Ord has made. A fine people, these
        elementals. They make marvels. Ord made them, and now they
        make miracles.</p>
        <p>We make marvels. The world is a miracle, and enough.</p>
        <p>Yes. But still. I think I might try my hand at children.
        It seems a worthy pursuit.</p>
        <p>Heed the lesson of our Shamèd Brother. It was better
        before the coming of the terrans. Before the coming of
        war.</p>
        <p>But war has come. Ord and I are of one mind in this:
        what is done cannot be undone. My children should not seek
        war, but they would excel at it should it come to them.</p>
        <p>They would be strong, like the elementals. But theirs
        would be a strength of spirit. They would never relent,
        never give up. Always seeking, always striving. Like life
        itself.</p>
        <p>They should love the forest and green things, like the
        children of Val. But they should be at home in the cities
        the terrans and elementals build. In this world of chaos
        and law, they should seek balance. Not quick to anger. But
        once angered? A wildfire.</p>
        <p>If they excel at war, the terrans will be jealous. They
        will be in constant conflict with each other.</p>
        <p>Perhaps. Yes, I think you're right. It seems to be the
        great tragedy of our creation, war. But the constant threat
        of it will bring wisdom. It will take great wisdom to avoid
        such conflict, and those possessed of such wisdom will
        become great leaders.</p>
        <p>Would they be lorewise and crafty?</p>
        <p>Oh, I would leave that to them. It is not meet that
        children should be too closely molded by their parents. But
        you ask, and my mind goes to Ket. They should lack the
        pride of Ket's children…</p>
        <p>Look where that got him.</p>
        <p>Hush, you. We should not be too hard on our Brother In
        Mourning. He has paid for his hubris. My children would
        love the world more than lore. That is my answer.</p>
        <p>They seem a fine people, if you ask me.</p>
        <p>And there they are, look at them! Kul, your thoughts
        made real! Only in the world a little while, and already
        growing, learning.</p>
        <p>Ah! My children! So fierce and unyielding. I see you
        lead short lives, like the terrans. Perhaps this is
        good.</p>
        <p>I see they get along well with Ord's children. I think
        this a good sign.</p>
        <p>Already they make homes in the forests by the elves.
        Some little skirmishing over borders, I note. Nothing
        serious.</p>
        <p>What shall you call them?</p>
        <p>Oh, I do not care for such things. They should be free
        of our designs, like the terrans. Let them name
        themselves.</p>
        <p>Oh! They already have! Kanin. It means “the people” in
        their tongue. I like that. Very democratic. Good for
        them.</p>
        <p>And will they know you?</p>
        <p>If they wish. Much as I agreed with…the Father of Men…I
        find worship unseemly.</p>
        <p>Agreed.</p>
        <p>Agreed!</p>
        <p>Let me introduce myself, at least.</p>
        <p>Ahem.</p>
        <p>“Hear me, kanin! This world we made is yours, as much as
        it is anyone's. You belong here.</p>
        <p>“Know that you are my children, the children of Kul, he
        who put fire within the world. And there is fire in you.
        And though the world and fate and baser minds may conspire
        to destroy your light, you will survive. And more than

      <h3>POLDER</h3>
      <p>“Wait, where'd he go? Where'd that little son of a bitch
      go? AAAAGGH!”</p>
      <p>After humans, polders are the most numerous and diverse
      ancestry in Orden. They are not humans, but they live in and
      among humans, sharing their gods and culture. Almost every
      human culture in Orden has a polder saint or a human saint
      venerated by polder.</p>
      <p>Short creatures averaging three-and-a-half feet tall,
      polders have obscure origins. They are a young species who,
      like humans, have no single patron god. Their natural ability
      to blend in with shadows makes them excellent spies and
      thieves. However, many polders consider this stereotype a
      base slander, pointing out that they're also famed as
      chefs—though polders can be found in virtually every
      profession, especially in cities.</p>
      <section id="on-polders" class="level4">
        <h4>ON POLDERS</h4>
        <p>The three peasants—Jago, his wife Sarah, and his sister
        Beth—sat together watching the three heroes talk in the
        crowded common room of the inn. Well, Jackson Bootblack
        seemed to be doing most of the talking.</p>
        <p>“This kind of shit doesn't work if it's just a bunch of
        ratcatchers like us,” the polder said. “You need the people
        to rise up. Been fifteen years since Omund died—fifteen
        years of fighting wolves and bandits and worse. The people
        welcome a tyrant after that. They like order, you know?
        They adapt.”</p>
        <p>“If you stand on the grass long enough, it learns to lie
        flat,” A Mist Coils Around Dying Embers said. “But what do
        you say?”</p>
        <p>“Eh?” the polder asked her. But he glanced at Sir John
        staring at him.</p>
        <p>“You say the people have no stomach for rebellion,”
        Embers said. “But what about you?”</p>
        <p>“Oh,” the polder said, “I say it doesn't matter much
        what I say. Why's he looking at me like that?” the polder
        asked the high elf and pointed at Sir John. Realizing he
        was being rude, John shook his head to clear it. “Sorry, I
        just … I never met a polder before,” he said.</p>
        <p>“Are you kidding me?” Jackson said.</p>
        <p>“No! Sorry, I just …”</p>
        <p>“What are you, from the moon? Where you from that you
        never met a polder before? There's polder in every fucking
        village and town from here to the sea.”</p>
        <p>“Really? That's weird. I'm from Tor, I've been all
        over—just never met a polder before.”</p>
        <p>Jackson looked at his friend, the high elf void mage.
        “Am I crazy?”</p>
        <p>“You're not crazy,” Embers smiled. She was enjoying
        watching two of her friends get to know each other.</p>
        <p>“John's just never run into one, it seems.”</p>
        <p>“Well, we're adorable,” the polder said, and drank some
        ale.</p>
        <p>“They must have been around I guess,” John said. “I
        probably just never noticed.”</p>
        <p>The polder put his drink down. “Oh, thank you. Thank you
        very much. You know, it's funny. I never have any problem
        noticing you big assholes. One of you makes about as much
        noise as a cow, which … I don't even know how you manage
        that.”</p>
        <p>“You're talking just … my voice is just as loud as
        yours!”</p>
        <p>“I mean the way you walk around. Just the way you move,
        the way you stand up and sit down. You make so much goddamn
        noise.”</p>
        <p>Jago, Sarah, and Beth all smiled at the exchange.</p>
        <p>“Humans are loud, yes,” Embers agreed.</p>
        <p>“Do we have to … can we talk about something else,
        please?”</p>
        <p>“I just …” The polder wouldn't let it go. “You seriously
        never … you never been to an inn? Cavall's teeth, I can't
        count how many inns and taverns I've been to run by
        polders, got polders in the kitchen or waiting tables. One
        of the only two things we're good at, I think.”</p>
        <p>“Yeah?” John asked. “What's the other one?”</p>
        <p>The little man smiled. “Getting into places we ain't
        supposed to be.”</p>
        <p>“Now we're talking,” Sir John said. “You were saying we
        need the people behind us. I agree.”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, okay. To business: How to rally the people.” The
        polder took the question seriously. “It's not hard. First,
        we need someone they'll rally around. I could make someone
        up, invent a local folk hero, but if we can find the real
        thing? They just need to look the part, that's all. I'll
        take care of the rest.”</p>
        <p>“I'm working on that,” John said. “But it's … slower
        going than I thought. I'm betting on a long shot.”</p>
        <p>“What's the holdup?”</p>
        <p>John thought about how to put what he knew into words.
        “You know,” he shrugged. “Some people can only be heroes if
        they think they're above everyone else. Some people can
        only be heroes once they realize they're not. And some
        people …”</p>
        <p>He looked at his drink, at the expensive clear glass the
        innkeep had given him because he recognized Sir John. He
        turned the glass slowly on the table and now he was mostly
        talking to himself. “Some people still have to figure that
        out.”</p>
        <p>“Which is best?” Jackson asked, and Embers could tell
        the little man was testing John.</p>
        <p>John took a deep breath and came back to reality. “Well.
        If we could be picky, we wouldn't need a hero,” he
        said.</p>
        <p>The polder looked at the high elf and nodded, impressed.
        Test passed.</p>
        <p>“Okay. Well, if you've already got a candidate, I could
        get things started. The other half is: we need a good
        story—short, punchy. Something that'll catch on, needs to
        be easy to relate to, but bigger than life. A tax. A toll!
        Bridge toll, classic. An ogre … no, three ogres. Yeah,
        three is better. Three ogres in Ajax's livery. A lone
        figure standing against them. See? Easy.”</p>
        <p>“Where are we going to find three ogres?” John
        asked.</p>
        <p>“What do you mean?” Now it was the polder's turn to be
        confused.</p>
        <p>“What do you mean, ‘What do I mean?'” John said.</p>
        <p>“I'm not … we don't need real ogres.” Jackson looked at
        the elf. “Is he for real?”</p>
        <p>“Trust me,” the void mage said.</p>
        <p>“You mean you're going to make it up?!” John
        exclaimed.</p>
        <p>“I…” Jackson looked with incredulity at the high elf
        void mage, then back at the human. “Yes, I do mean that.
        Does he know what I do?” he asked the elf.</p>
        <p>“He'll learn,” Embers smiled.</p>
        <p>The polder turned back to Sir John. “Hello. I lie for a
        living. And I'm really good at it. Sometimes also kill
        people, but only if lying or running away doesn't
        work.”</p>
        <p>John turned to Embers. “I thought he was a thief.”</p>
        <p>“I was a thief,” the polder said.</p>
        <p>“You were a thief.”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, I was with the Clock. Probably still am—they
        don't exactly let you just walk away. We sort of have an
        agreement. I agree to do what they tell me and they agree
        not to tell me to do anything.”</p>
        <p>“Did they kick you out, or did you quit?”</p>
        <p>“Depends on who you ask. I don't like being told what to
        do. It's sort of a polder thing. Hereditary or ancestral or
        whatever. Everybody wants a polder chef until they start
        trying to tell us what to cook.”</p>
        <p>“So what are you now?”</p>
        <p>“I'm annoying.”</p>
        <p>The elf smiled. “He's a troubadour—one of the best.”</p>
        <p>Sir John looked at him, nodded. “No lute, I notice. And
        you don't seem the type to sit by the hearth telling
        stories.”</p>
        <p>The polder grinned. “I ain't that kind of troubadour.
        I'm the other kind. I think the best story is the one
        people tell each other.”</p>
        <p>“Propaganda,” Sir John said, a grin spreading across his
        face. The polder pointed a finger at him and smiled. John
        heard the door to the inn open behind him. This wasn't
        notable, but the gasp from the customers was.</p>
        <p>“Hey,” the polder said, looking past John to the
        doorway. “Hey, I think our folk hero just showed up. Damn,
        he looks the part all right. Or she, I can never tell with
        these guys.”</p>
        <p>John turned to see. Sir Vaantikalisax loomed just inside
        the doorway, his scales and armor glowing in the light of
        the hearth fire. Sir John shot up out of his chair, a huge
        smile on his face.</p>
        <p>“I, uh …” Vaantikalisax said. The tall, broad draconian
        looked from John to the three peasants. Jago, Sarah, and
        Beth were beaming with even more joy than John, if that
        were possible.</p>
        <p>The knight stared at them for a moment, then turned back
        to his friend.</p>
        <p>“Maybe you're right,” the dragon knight said.</p>

      <h3>REVENANT</h3>
      <p>“I will suck the life from your flesh and leave you a
      withered corpse!”</p>
      <p>The revenant null flexed his arms and assumed a fighting
      pose. He smiled.</p>
      <p>“Little late for that.”</p>
      <p>The dead walk among us. Some of them are happier about it
      than others.</p>
      <p>Unlike the necromantic rituals that produce wights and
      wraiths and zombies, revenants rise from the grave through a
      combination of an unjust death and a burning desire for
      vengeance. Creatures sustained on pure will, they have no
      need of food or water or air—and, unlike their zombified
      cousins, they retain all their memories and personality from
      life.</p>
      <p>These revenants are rare. Many are hunted by ignorant
      villagers who see only their dead flesh and assume the worst.
      Those who survive the pitchfork brigade either choose a
      solitary life, often as a wandering soul seeking out living
      company yet constantly in fear of it, or they migrate to a
      metropolis such as Blackbottom or Capital, where lost souls
      gather to make a home.</p>

        <h4>ON REVENANTS</h4>
        <p>“I'm telling you, we are being followed.”</p>
        <p>“No one knows we're here. No one even knows this place
        exists! We got all day. We stash everything here, and take
        a sample to …” The head thief pulled a vial out of a crate
        stuffed with straw and looked at it.</p>
        <p>“It's just …” The junior cutpurse spoke nervously.
        “There was this lady knight in Blackbottom sniffing around.
        She seemed serious. I got this weird … chill when I looked
        at her.”</p>
        <p>“Hey,” the head thief said, his brow furrowed as he
        looked at the label on the vial. “Where'd you say you
        bought this stuff? You said a ship—a ship from where?”</p>
        <p>“I dunno, uh … uh, Capital I think.”</p>
        <p>The head thief looked at the panicking cutpurse. “This
        lady knight—she have a red and blue device on her
        shield?”</p>
        <p>“Black gods,” one of the other thieves said. “It can't
        be Lady Filliamo, can it?”</p>
        <p>There was a firm knock at the door to the safe house. A
        door which, from the outside, looked like an unremarkable
        section of wall.</p>
        <p>“Oh, you've got to be kidding me.”</p>
        <p>“Nonono! How could she … Capital was nine months
        ago!”</p>
        <p>“She's a revenant, idiot! She doesn't even need air. She
        could have walked here! Just … into the water and across
        the bottom of the sea! Black gods, why didn't you say
        anything?”</p>
        <p>“I did! You asshole, I just did! I been trying to tell
        you for—”</p>
        <p>“Man, there is a difference between, ‘Hey I think we're
        being shadowed,' and, ‘There's a deathless copper coming
        after us!'”</p>
        <p>One of the four thieves opened a vial and dipped his
        dirk into the red oil within.</p>
        <p>“What is that gonna do? She's already dead!”</p>
        <p>Another knock at the hidden door. “Forget it. Let her
        knock. Grab as many as you can, and we'll go out the
        back.”</p>
        <p>The head thief ran for the door out the back of the safe
        house. He jerked it open—and the other thieves watched as a
        silver flash silently flared across his forehead.</p>
        <p>Through the open door, they could see the silhouette of
        the knight, her open hand held up in front of her.</p>
        <p>She clenched her hand into a fist and the judgment she
        had placed on the head cutpurse detonated, hurling him
        backward. He sprawled across the floor, conscious but
        stunned.</p>
        <p>The gray-skinned knight walked into the room. Metal
        heels rang out on the wooden floor. She seemed relaxed, but
        her eyes burned with inner fire.</p>
        <p>“Boys,” Lady Filliamo said pleasantly. “Busy
        morning.”</p>
        <p>“How did you … this is impossible, how did you find
        us?”</p>
        <p>She looked at the man groaning on the floor. “Your boss
        didn't tell you about the vengeance mark?”</p>
        <p>“You marked us. Back in Capital. You marked one of us
        and just … just walked here.”</p>
        <p>“Don't be stupid. I marked you in Blackbottom. Capital
        was just normal detective work. I came here by ship.” She
        smiled—black lips on pale gray skin.</p>
        <p>“Come on.” The braver of the three remaining thieves
        drew twin daggers. “She can't get all of us at—”</p>
        <p>Lady Filliamo made a broad gesture with her right hand
        and argent marks flared across the foreheads of all three
        thieves. A clatter of weapons hitting the floor. Three
        pairs of hands slowly rose in the air.</p>
        <p>“Good boys. Here, put these on.” She tossed three pairs
        of manacles on the floor.</p>
        <p>“Hang on, you can't arrest us,” one of the thieves,
        unarmed and still holding his hands up, said. “This isn't
        Capital. You don't have jurisdiction!”</p>
        <p>Lady Filliamo shrugged. “I'm a knight of the church.
        Jurisdiction's for the city watch.” She drew her silver
        sword a few inches from the scabbard just to show them the
        blade.</p>
        <p>“I deal in steel.”</p>

      <h3>TIME RAIDER</h3>
      <p>“I fear no living thing, but the time raiders.”</p>
      <p>—Chief Executive Admiral Lithiri Aswandala</p>
      <p>Commander of the HOV First Get Behind Them Memonek</p>
      <p>The original servitor species of the synliiroi—evil psions
      with near god-like power—the kuran'zoi liberated themselves
      during the First Psychic War. In the centuries since, they
      built their own culture and civilization as nomads of the
      timescape. The exonym “time raiders” was given to them by
      denizens of the lower worlds who, seeing the advanced
      technology they wield, concluded they must be from the
      future.</p>
      <p>Extraordinarily rare in Orden, the time raiders thrive on
      the Sea of Stars, the Sea Between Worlds, where the winds of
      limbo roar.</p>
      <p>In place of eyes, kuran'zoi possess crystalline ocular
      sensors that grant them high-spectral vision hardened against
      the extreme radiations encountered in the Sea of Stars,
      permitting them to operate freely outside their vessels with
      only their portable rebreathers. Time raiders also have two
      sets of arms, allowing them to wield melee weapons at the
      same time as ranged weapons. A single well-trained kuran'zoi
      is like a squad unto themself.</p>
      <section id="on-time-raiders" class="level4">
        <h4>ON TIME RAIDERS</h4>
        <p>“You will tell me the location of the ship you came here
        in.”</p>
        <p>Taxiarch Lycaon paced outside the ruined church. The
        four-armed woman with crystal eyes and flaming pink hair in
        a strip down the center of her shaved head sneered at him.
        She was chained to the ruin of a stone column outside the
        ruin of a stone church.</p>
        <p>“Is it that your brain is so small you must talk in
        order to think?” The woman's smile was a sneer.</p>
        <p>Lycaon strode toward the alien, grabbed a length of
        chain around her waist, and yanked on it, pulling it taut
        so the chain around her neck tightened. “You are going to
        die in any event,” he said. “If you wish to deny me the
        pleasure of hearing you howl and scream for mercy, tell me
        what I want to know now and my dogs will kill you
        quickly.”</p>
        <p>Up close she could see the fine stitching along Lycaon's
        cheeks and forehead, the very slight differences in skin
        tone that showed his skin was not his own.</p>
        <p>“You seem to be made of bits,” the alien said as she
        peered at Lycaon, her crystalline eyes catching and
        reflecting prismatic light. “And not the best bits.
        Leftovers? Is that what you are? A walking assemblage of
        cast-off scraps? Hahah, I thought the proteans were
        hideous. Someone should let them know! There are creatures
        even more foul-seeming and useless in the timescape.”</p>
        <p>The Taxiarch smiled to himself, nodded with respect at
        the woman's epithets. He placed his foot on a low piece of
        rubble, once part of the wall of the stone church, and
        leaned his arm on his knee. He was not dressed as the other
        war dogs. No black leather for him. He wore a gold
        breastplate with the embossed head of a ram molded into it,
        a white cape over his back. Gold greaves and red leather
        boots and gloves. The other war dogs only had patches of
        hair but his was long and blonde.</p>
        <p>He struck a casual, jaunty pose. “Where is your
        worldship?” he said in a more reasonable voice. “Or came
        you here in a single-seater starskimmer?” At this, the
        alien's crystal eyes went wide, betraying surprise.</p>
        <p>“You see?” The Taxiarch said, impressed with himself. “I
        am not a primitive like these peasants, who hounded you
        because you are alien,” he nodded at the folk of the small
        town watching from the stables some distance away. “I am
        Ajax's elite. Better than his chosen. I was made for
        victory.”</p>
        <p>Indeed, Taxiarch Lycaon looked almost fully human.
        Handsome and fit like a statue from Phaedros, which his
        model had almost certainly been inspired by. Unless you
        looked closely, there was no sign he was a product of the
        body banks. “If you agree to lead me to your vessel, I will
        let you go free.”</p>
        <p>The alien sighed. “‘Blaap blaap blaap,'” she said. “You
        should hear yourself. Like barking thrazz, you sound to me.
        Who holds your leash I wonder? For surely a microbrain such
        as you could not command any more than these rabble,” she
        nodded her head at the other twenty or so war dogs.</p>
        <p>Her taunts worked. Lycaon hauled back and punched the
        alien in the jaw. Her head smashed into the ruined column.
        She was dazed but she shook it off and laughed.</p>
        <p>“Look how easily this one is goaded!” she said. She spat
        out dark blue blood and turned to the peasants gathered.
        “You people! Why do you let yourselves be cowed by these …
        bits? Bits of people kludged together? Even the least of
        you is worth more than these.”</p>
        <p>“Perhaps from the air,” Flight Captain Lyria offered,
        and she stroked the feathers of her giant hawk mount to
        calm it. “I could scout the forest around the …”</p>
        <p>“No!” Taxiarch Lycaon pointed a finger at the hawklord
        and strode toward her. “You are the elite of Ajax's winged
        harriers, I am his chosen brigade commander. We are not
        scavengers! This one,” he stabbed a gloved finger at the
        alien, “will come to heel, or I will give her to my war
        dogs.” He turned to face the chained alien, who yawned.
        Lycaon seethed.</p>
        <p>“They may pull you apart,” he said to her, and at this,
        his squadron of soldiers, all in black leather and golden
        pauldrons, started making barking sounds. Then they laughed
        at each other.</p>
        <p>“Or I may let my crucibite melt the skin from your
        bones.”</p>
        <p>At that, a war dog clad in leather from head to foot
        wearing a heavy mask with glass circles where the eyes
        should be and some kind of canister over his mouth stepped
        forward. The long thin brass tube in his hands connected to
        a large metal tank on his back.</p>
        <p>“Shall I let you choose?” the Taxiarch said and drew a
        dagger from his belt. “I will cut off one finger. If you
        cry out, I kill you. If not, another finger. And if you cry
        out then…”</p>
        <p>Slowly everyone assembled could make out the sounds of a
        conversation, quiet with a metallic ring to it. The voices
        got louder until eventually they could be heard.</p>
        <p>“…should be ready for anything,” one voice said, deep,
        commanding, and images started to form around and between
        the war dogs, the hawklord, and the Taxiarch. Like faded
        images in a manuscript they seemed, gaining pigment and
        clarity and, eventually, depth as their voices grew louder
        and clearer.</p>
        <p>“Oh, thank you for the brilliant tactical advice,”
        another voice, high pitched, piped up.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the images became three dimensional, solid,
        and four heroes stood among them. A human in working battle
        plate. A polder with twin rapiers in his hands. A tall
        willowy high elf with night-black skin and golden hair. And
        a Dragon Knight. The people of the town gasped when they
        saw him. Even at a distance, even with the war dogs between
        them, they recognized the device of Good King Omund on the
        knight's shield.</p>
        <p>The war dogs scrambled. For a moment, it seemed they
        might flee at this sudden intrusion, but the Taxiarch
        bellowed “Hold fast!” and they held their ground,
        uncertainty over the unknown threat of a band of heroes
        battling in each of them with the certain fear of their
        commander.</p>
        <p>John immediately read the situation. It was a clear
        enough picture.</p>
        <p>There was something about the war dogs. They loved
        Ajax's cruelty—reveled in it. John had crossed swords with
        other commanders in Ajax's army before. Ground Commander
        Vordokov was a professional—could be reasoned with, but he
        was an orc.</p>
        <p>Not the war dogs—they were fanatics.</p>
        <p>“What's this?” the Taxiarch called out with a hungry
        grin. “Allies of the alien?” He was projecting confidence.
        Trying to muster his wary soldiers.</p>
        <p>Sir John ignored the war dog, tilted his head toward the
        alien. “Embers?”</p>
        <p>“A kuran'zoi,” the high elf said, and the alien held her
        head up with pride. “A time raider from the upper worlds.
        What the truth is I cannot say, and no people are all one
        thing. But by reputation? They're intractable,
        ungovernable, they loathe authority, hate tyranny and are
        totally, utterly without fear.”</p>
        <p>John watched the alien. They sneered their approval at
        Ember's summary. That was enough for Sir John, they could
        work out the details later. After everything they'd been
        through before, he trusted Embers implicitly.</p>
        <p>He could see the shape of the next moments play out, all
        he had to do was take the initiative. If he was right, the
        whole thing would be over in seconds. There was no time to
        communicate. No time to plan, and everyone, everyone had to
        play their part.</p>
        <p>John knew what came next, but he wasn't an assassin. He
        had his own part to play. He took a step forward, away from
        his teammates, and noted the Taxiarch didn't react. This
        spoke volumes. He locked eyes with his enemy.</p>
        <p>“She goes free,” John commanded, his voice steel, “or
        you die here.” He could feel the muscles tightening in his
        comrades, the whole company like a steel spring wound
        tight.</p>
        <p>Lycaon cocked his head at Sir John and took a few
        foolish steps toward the tactician. He was just out of
        reach. But close enough.</p>
        <p>“I see you are a man, like Ajax. Why do you lower
        yourself with these … creatures?” the war dog Taxiarch
        looked at the elf, polder, and dragon knight. “Little more
        than slimy things crawled out of the sea? Join us. Join me.
        Join Ajax. It'll be nice for you,” his voice lowered almost
        to a whisper, “to be on the winning side for a change.”</p>
        <p>Sir John took a deep breath, his body language changed
        and that was enough. Several things then happened at once,
        so quickly no one would later be able to say who acted
        first.</p>
        <p>Ember's eyes flashed into a starfield. The time raider's
        chains dissolved into starspace and reappeared around
        Flight Captain Lyria pinning her arms to her side. She was
        giving the hawklord an excuse to sit this one out. Gods,
        John was glad she was with them.</p>
        <p>The time raider's right upper hand shot out, as though
        she'd been waiting for the void mage to do exactly what she
        just did, and her meson blaster leapt out of the hands of
        the war dog who'd chained her. The pistol made of glass and
        bronze slammed into her hand and its tip flared with
        prismatic light.</p>
        <p>From the sun's shadow cast by Taxiarch Lycaon, the
        polder Jackson Bootblack emerged, a rapier in each hand,
        and no one had seen him move from where he'd been a moment
        before.</p>
        <p>At the same instant, a call—a horn. From directly behind
        John a blast of sound like a chord played by a dozen
        trumpets, and hope sang in John's heart—the Clarion Call of
        the last Storm Knight!</p>
        <p>John hadn't hesitated, he'd already drawn his sword.</p>
        <p>“All right, you patchwork son of a bitch.” He charged
        Lycaon, who fumbled with the short-sword on his belt.</p>

    <h2>CULTURE</h2>
    <p>What makes a hero? Is their desire to stand up for the
    innocent and protect others somehow innate? Are they born
    knowing that tyrants must fall? Does a higher power instill the
    idea that sometimes those least deserving of compassion are
    those who need it most?</p>
    <p>No. A hero's life experience teaches them right from
    wrong—and that experience starts with the culture that raised
    them.</p>
    <p>(Playtest note: Sample cultures are coming.)</p>
    <section id="creating-a-culture" class="level3">
      <h3>CREATING A CULTURE</h3>
      <p>A hero's culture describes the beliefs, customs, values,
      and way of life held by the community in which they were
      raised. This community provides life experiences that give a
      character some of their game statistics. Even if a hero
      doesn't share their culture's values, those values shaped
      their early development and way of life. In fact, some people
      become heroes primarily from the rejection of the ways of
      their culture.</p>
      <p>For our purposes, a hero's culture represents people, not
      a place. Yes, you might have grown up in the city of Capital,
      but your culture is more specific than that. One hero's
      culture might be House Alvaro, a noble house in Capital where
      they were raised. Another's culture could be a group or
      organization that moves around, such as a band of pirates or
      a secret order of sorcerers sworn to protect books of fell
      magic. It helps to get specific when thinking about your
      culture, and working with the four aspects of a culture can
      help you do that: language, environment, organization, and
      upbringing.</p>
      <section id="using-culture" class="level4">
        <h4>USING CULTURE</h4>
        <p>Directors can use the rules in this section to build
        cultures that players can choose for their characters.
        Players can use these rules to build a unique culture or
        modify an existing culture for their character, working
        with the Director to find a right place for that culture
        within the world of the campaign's world. The Vasloria
        Cultures table provides a cultural breakdown for Vasloria,
        the game's medieval European fantasy analog.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>(Playtest note: That table is still to come.)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>You can use the table for a campaign that takes place in
        Vasloria, or pillage from it liberally for a custom
        setting.</p>
        <p>In many worlds, at least some cultures have a majority
        ancestry. The people of Bedegar, a duchy in Vasloria, are
        mostly humans. The folk dwelling in the Great Wode, a
        forest realm north of Bedegar, are primarily wode elves.
        However, you can always choose to be from one of these
        cultures and take a different ancestry. A dwarf raised in
        the culture of the Great Wode speaks Yllyric and probably
        knows a lot about nature, while a dwarf raised in the
        dwarven thanedom of Kal Kalavar speaks Zaliac and might
        know a good deal about smithing.</p>

        <h4>WHY BUILD A CULTURE?</h4>
        <p>Building a character is about more than adding up your
        stats, picking skills and abilities, and recording that
        information on a character sheet. You're building a hero—a
        main character in a story, be it a one-shot or a heroic
        campaign. Think about the personality and the past of who
        you are creating. That's why the game lets you build a
        culture rather than simply saying, “Pick three skills and a
        bonus language.” We want players to imagine their heroes as
        complex and intricate characters.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You know the language of your culture, in addition to
        knowing Caelian.</li>
        <li>From the environment, organization, and upbringing

        <h4>LANGUAGE</h4>
        <p>Your culture's language aspect determines how the people
        of your culture communicate. This can be any language in
        Languages.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="environment" class="level4">
        <h4>ENVIRONMENT</h4>
        <p>Your culture's environment aspect describes where the
        people of that culture spend most of their time. Is your
        culture centered in a bustling city or a small village? Did
        you spend your early life in an isolated monastery? Or did
        you wander the wilderness, never staying in one place for
        long?</p>
        <p>When you build a culture, select its environment aspect
        from the following options: nomadic, rural, secluded,
        urban, or wilderness. You then gain skill options from your
        chosen environment. All of these environments can be found
        in any sort of terrain, whether aboveground, in
        subterranean caverns, deep in trackless forest, or even

          <h6>NOMADIC</h6>
          <p>A nomadic culture travels from place to place to
          survive. They might follow animal migrations or the
          weather, travel to sell their wares or services, or
          simply enjoy a restless lifestyle full of new experiences
          and peoples. Those who grow up in nomadic cultures learn
          to navigate the wilderness and interact with others.</p>

        <section id="rural" class="level6">
          <h6>RURAL</h6>
          <p>A rural culture is one located in a town, village, or
          smaller settled enclave. People dwelling in such places
          often cultivate the land, trade goods or services with
          travelers passing through, harvest fish from the sea, or
          mine metals and gems from the earth.</p>
          <p>Living among a small population, most folks in a rural
          community learn a trade and are handed down bits of
          essential knowledge to help their community survive. For
          example, when a rural culture has only one blacksmith,
          it's important to have an apprentice already learning at
          the anvil well before that smith starts to get old. If
          the only priest in town gets the sniffles, folks want an
          acolyte ready to wear the fancy robes should the worst
          occur.</p>

          <h6>SECLUDED</h6>
          <p>A secluded culture is based in one relatively
          close-quarters structure—a building, a cavern, and so
          forth—and interacts with other cultures only rarely. Such
          places are often buildings or complexes such as
          monasteries, castles, or prisons. Folk in a secluded
          culture have little or no reason to leave their home or
          interact with other cultures on the outside, but might
          have an awareness of those cultures and of events
          happening outside their enclave.</p>
          <p>When people live together in close quarters, they
          typically learn to get along. They often spend much time
          in study or introspection, as there is not much else to
          do in seclusion.</p>

        <section id="urban" class="level6">
          <h6>URBAN</h6>
          <p>An urban culture is always centered in a city. Such a
          culture might arise within the walls of Capital, a
          massive metropolis with a cosmopolitan population; within
          a network of caverns that hold an underground city; or in
          any other place where a large population lives relatively
          close together. The people of urban cultures often learn
          to effectively misdirect others in order to navigate the
          crowds and the political machinations that can come with
          city life.</p>

          <h6>WILDERNESS</h6>
          <p>A wilderness culture doesn't attempt to tame the
          terrain in which its people live, whether desert, forest,
          swamp, tundra, ocean, or more exotic climes. Instead, the
          folk of such a culture thrive amid nature, taking their
          sustenance and shelter from the land itself. A wilderness
          culture might be a circle of druids protecting a great
          wode, a band of brigands hiding out in desert caves, or a
          camp of orc mercenaries who call the trackless mountains
          home. People in a wilderness culture learn how to use the
          land for all they need to live, typically crafting their
          own tools, clothing, and more.</p>

        <h4>ORGANIZATION</h4>
        <p>Your culture's organization aspect determines the
        functioning and leadership of your community. You might
        come from a place with an officially recognized government
        and a system of laws. Or your culture might have enjoyed a
        less formal organization, with the people in charge having
        naturally gravitated toward their positions without any
        official offices or oaths.</p>
        <p>When you build a culture, select its organization aspect
        from the following options: anarchic, bureaucratic, or
        communal. You then gain skill options from your chosen
        system of organization.</p>
        <section id="anarchic" class="level5">
          <h5>ANARCHIC</h5>
          <p>In an anarchic culture, there are no rules and no one
          person leads the others. This might sound like complete
          chaos—people taking what they want when they want it—and
          some cultures that practice anarchy are. Other anarchic
          cultures are peaceful places where people mostly work for
          themselves, their friends, or their family, but rely on
          the whole group when times get tough.</p>
          <p>Many anarchic cultures come together when the need
          arises, but they leave day-to-day responsibilities up to
          the individual. If an informal leader appears, it's
          because each member of the culture has decided to follow
          that person for a time, and the leader enjoys their power
          only as long as they keep everyone happy. A group of
          rangers who protect a vast forest, a gang of rebels
          fighting against a tyrannical despot leader, and a bandit
          group roving the wilds without a leader are all anarchic
          cultures.</p>
          <p>Most anarchic cultures operate outside of settled
          lands, sticking to the wilds, city sewers, or other
          secret places. For even when such cultures are harmless,
          their members know that outsiders might try to impose
          rules upon them if they live in the same place. As such,
          many folks in anarchic cultures learn how to navigate the
          wilds and fend for themselves while avoiding the danger
          that other folks can represent.</p>

        <section id="bureaucratic" class="level5">
          <h5>BUREAUCRATIC</h5>
          <p>Bureaucratic cultures are steeped in official
          leadership and formally recorded laws. Members of such a
          culture are often ranked in power according to those
          laws, with a small group of people holding the power to
          rule according to birthright, popular vote, or some other
          official and measurable standard. Many bureaucratic
          communities have one person at the very top, though
          others might be ruled by a council. A trade guild with a
          guildmaster, treasurer, secretary, and a charter of rules
          and regulations for membership; a feudal lord who rules
          over a group of knights, who in turn rule over peasants
          who work the land; and a militaristic society with ranks
          and rules that its people must abide are all examples of
          bureaucratic cultures.</p>
          <p>Those who thrive in bureaucratic cultures don't just
          follow the rules. They know how to use those rules to
          their advantage, either bending, changing, or
          reinterpreting policy to advance their own interests.
          Schmoozing with those who make the laws is often key to
          this approach. Others in a bureaucratic culture might
          specialize in operating outside the strict regulations
          that govern the culture without getting caught.</p>

          <h5>COMMUNAL</h5>
          <p>A communal culture has no formal book of laws or rules
          for governing. Instead, the community works together to
          pick leaders and make important decisions. Often in these
          cultures, each person has a relatively equal say in how
          the culture operates, and everyone contributes to help
          the culture survive and thrive. People share the burdens
          of governing, physical labor, childcare, and other
          duties. A collective of farmers who work together to
          cultivate and protect their land without a noble, a city
          of pirates where each person can do as they wish, and a
          traveling theatrical troupe whose members vote on every
          artistic and administrative decision are all communal
          cultures.</p>
          <p>Some communal cultures have one or more people who
          serve as leaders, but the way these leaders come to power
          is never official. Some are thrust into the role by
          people who admire their stances and actions. Other
          leaders seize power without the help of an official
          process, dethroning a previous leader and claiming their
          power without a challenge. People in communal cultures
          learn that their voice and individuality has worth, as do
          the opinions and hard work of others.</p>

        <h4>UPBRINGING</h4>
        <p>Your culture's upbringing aspect is a more specific and
        personal part of your hero's story, describing how you were
        individually raised within your culture. Were you trained
        to become the newest archmage in a secret order of wizards,
        or to be a sword-wielding bodyguard who protected that
        arcane organization? Did you learn to delve deep into mines
        looking for ore in a mountain kingdom, or did you build
        machines meant to dig faster and deeper than any person
        could alone? Whatever your culture, your upbringing makes
        you special within that culture.</p>
        <p>Pick your upbringing aspect from the following list:
        academic, creative, illegal, labor, martial, or noble. You
        then gain skill options from your chosen aspect.</p>
        <section id="academic" class="level5">
          <h5>ACADEMIC</h5>
          <p>Heroes with an academic upbringing were raised by
          people who collect, study, and share books and other
          records. Some academics focus on one area of study, such
          as a college for wizards dedicated to the study of magic,
          or a church that teaches the word of one deity. People in
          an academic culture learn how to wield the power that is
          knowledge.</p>

        <section id="creative" class="level5">
          <h5>CREATIVE</h5>
          <p>Heroes with a creative upbringing were raised among
          folk who create art or other works valuable enough to
          trade. A creative culture might produce fine art such as
          dance, music, or sculpture, or more practical wares such
          as wagons, weapons, tools, or buildings. People in such
          cultures learn the value of quality crafting and
          attention to detail.</p>

          <p>Heroes with an illegal upbringing had caregivers who
          performed activities that other folk—whether within or
          outside their culture—considered unlawful. A band of
          pirates, a guild of assassins, or an organization of
          spies all commit unlawful acts for money. People with
          illegal upbringings typically don't mind breaking the
          rules when it suits them—and are good at making sure no
          one finds out they did.</p>

          <h5>LABOR</h5>
          <p>People who labor for a living survive through
          cultivation, typically raising crops or livestock on a
          farm; by harvesting natural resources, whether by
          hunting, trapping, logging, or mining; or through manual
          labor tied to settlement and trade, such as construction,
          carting, loading cargo, and so forth. People with a labor
          upbringing know the value of hard work.</p>

          <p>Heroes who have a martial upbringing are raised by

          army, a band of mercenaries, a guild of monster-slaying
          adventurers, or any other folk whose lives revolve around
          combat. Heroes with a martial upbringing are always ready

        <section id="noble" class="level5">
          <h5>NOBLE</h5>
          <p>Heroes with a noble upbringing were raised by leaders
          who rule over others and play the games of politics to
          maintain power. Many families are nobles by birthright,
          but some cultures have noble titles that are earned
          through deeds or popularity. Whatever the case, heroes
          with this background understand why the whispered words
          in the right ear can sometimes be more powerful than any
          army.</p>

      of questions that you should think about to help you define
      the specific details of your hero's career. For instance, if

      <h3>INCITING INCIDENT</h3>
      <p>Each career has a list of inciting incidents, each of
      which suggests a potential reason why you gave up your
      career, turned away from a possibly comfortable and reliable
      living, and took up the sword (or axe or wand) to become an
      adventuring hero. Each inciting incident represents a
      life-changing event that might have motivated you to change
      course, becoming a person who risks it all to save
      others.</p>
      <p>You can roll for or choose an inciting incident from the
      table that accompanies each career. You can also use the
      table as inspiration and work with your Director to come up
      with a unique inciting incident of your own.</p>

      <section id="what-was-taken-from-you" class="level4">
        <h4>WHAT WAS TAKEN FROM YOU?</h4>
        <p>During your inciting incident, something was taken from
        you. It might have been a material object, such as an
        heirloom sword or a locket that proves your royal heritage.
        It could be a person you loved who was killed, kidnapped,
        or cursed. It might be something deeper and more abstract,
        as with a chance for happiness or a lifetime goal snatched
        away.</p>
        <p>It might be the case that you're obsessed with getting
        back what you lost. You might be in a position where you'll
        never recover what was taken from you, but you want to
        prevent that same loss from happening to others. It might
        be a little bit of both. Whatever the case, the loss you've
        suffered is part of what drives you to be a hero. Record
        what was taken from you on your character sheet, and let
        your Director know.</p>

    <h2>CONDUIT</h2>
    <p>The power of the gods flows through you! As a vessel for
    divine magic, you don't just keep your allies in the fight. You
    make those allies more effective, even as you rain divine
    energy down upon your foes. While the deity or saint you serve
    might have other faithful and clergy, you are special among
    worshippers, receiving your abilities from the highest
    source.</p>
    <p>As a conduit, you heal and buff your allies, and debuff your
    foes while smiting them with divine magic. The spark of
    divinity within you shines, aweing your enemies and granting
    you increased empathy.</p>

        <p>When a combat encounter begins, you keep any piety you
        had outside of combat. At the start of each of your turns
        during combat, you gain 2 piety. You can also use the

          make a test that uses a skill you have from the intrigue
          skill group, you can use Intuition on the test instead of

          <p>If you spend 10 minutes in an uninterrupted meditative
          state without moving, you get a glimpse of any
          significant events that will happen in the area around
          you in the next 24 hours unless you or your allies
          intercede in those events. As described by the Director,
          these glimpses of the future might be clear and concise,
          or might be vague and hard to understand.</p>

      <h3>1ST-LEVEL FEATURES</h3>
      <p>As an elementalist, you gain the following features.</p>
      <section id="elemental-specialization" class="level4">
        <h4>ELEMENTAL SPECIALIZATION</h4>
        <p>Through your studies, you know and can manipulate the
        seven primal elements of the timescape:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Air</strong> is the element of movement. Air
          abilities allow you to manipulate speed, quickness,
          flight, and breath.</li>
          <li><strong>Earth</strong> is the element of permanence.
          Earth abilities create and shape physical terrain in a
          permanent way, and bolster the strength and hardiness of
          allies.</li>
          <li><strong>Fire</strong> is the element of destruction.
          Fire abilities harm enemies and objects.</li>
          <li><strong>Green</strong> is the element of creation and
          growth. Green abilities make and manipulate plants,
          fungi, and other forms of life to hamper foes and nourish
          your allies.</li>
          <li><strong>Rot</strong> is the element of death. Rot
          abilities decay and debuff enemies.</li>
          <li><strong>Void</strong> is the element of the unknown.
          Void abilities warp space and reality, allowing you to
          teleport, create illusions, and make things
          incorporeal.</li>
          <li><strong>Water</strong> is the element of change.
          Water abilities enhance what your allies can do, and
          alter the abilities of your enemies for the worse.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Heroic abilities that include your specialization's
        keyword have their initial essence cost reduced by 1 (to a
        minimum of 1). This reduced cost doesn't apply to abilities
        you gain because of your specialization, such as Manipulate
        Earth or Void Sight.</p>
        <p>Choose one of the following elements to be your
        specialty: earth, fire, green, or void. (Other elemental
        specializations will be featured in future products.) Your
        choice of specialization determines many of the features
        you'll gain from this class.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="essence" class="level4">
        <h4>ESSENCE</h4>
        <p>You channel the substance of creation in the form of a
        Heroic Resource called essence. In times of great stress,
        you can focus your control on this substance, gathering and
        burning it to cast and maintain spells.</p>
        <p>Outside of combat and other dangerous situations tracked
        in turns and rounds, you have essence equal to your
        Victories. If you lose some or all of this essence outside
        of combat, it takes you 1 minute to regain it. You can also
        dedicate that essence to maintaining persistent abilities
        (see Persistent Magic below).</p>
        <p>When combat begins, you keep any essence you had outside
        of combat. At the start of each of your turns during
        combat, you gain 2 essence. When combat ends, you once more
        have essence equal to your Victories.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="hurl-element" class="level4">
        <h4>HURL ELEMENT</h4>
        <p>You gain the following ability, which can be used as a
        ranged free strike:</p>
        <section id="hurl-element-1" class="level5">
          <h5>HURL ELEMENT</h5>
          <p>You hurl a ball of elemental energy at a nearby

            <li><strong>Type</strong>: Action</li>
            <li><strong>Distance</strong>: Ranged 5</li>
            <li><strong>Target</strong>: 1 creature or object</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Power Roll + Reason</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>11 or lower: 2 damage (type varies)</li>
            <li>12–16: 6 damage (type varies)</li>
            <li>17+: 9 damage (type varies)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Effect</strong>: When you make this attack,
          choose the damage type from one of the following options:
          acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or
          sonic.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section id="persistent-magic" class="level4">
        <h4>PERSISTENT MAGIC</h4>
        <p>Some of your heroic abilities have the Persistent
        keyword. Whenever you use a persistent ability, you decide
        whether you want to maintain it. If you maintain a
        persistent ability in combat, you reduce the amount of
        essence you earn at the start of your turn by an amount
        equal to the ability's persistent value, which enables the
        ability's persistent effect. All your active persistent
        abilities end when combat ends.</p>
        <p>You can maintain a persistent ability outside of combat
        as long as you have Victories equal to or greater than its
        persistent value. If you maintain a persistent ability
        outside of combat, the maximum essence you can use on other
        abilities is reduced by the ability's persistent value. For
        instance, if you have 4 Victories and maintain the Stone
        Ward ability (a persistent ability with a cost of 1
        essence), you can only use abilities costing 3 essence or
        less outside of combat.</p>
        <p>You can't maintain any abilities that would make you
        earn a negative amount of essence at the start of your turn
        or have a negative amount of essence outside of combat. You
        can stop maintaining an ability at any time (no action
        required).</p>
        <p>If you maintain the same ability on several targets and
        the effect includes a power roll, you make that roll once
        and apply the same effect to all targets. A creature can't
        be affected by multiple instances of a persistent
        ability.</p>
        <p>Whenever you take damage while you have an active
        persistent ability, you must make the following power
        roll.</p>
        <p><strong>Power Roll + Reason</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>11 or lower: You lose all active persistent
          abilities.</li>
          <li>12–16: If you have only one persistent ability
          active, it remains active. Otherwise, you lose one active
          persistent ability of your choice.</li>
          <li>17+: All your active persistent abilities remain
          active.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="practical-magic" class="level4">
        <h4>PRACTICAL MAGIC</h4>
        <p>You have the following ability:</p>
        <section id="practical-magic-1" class="level5">
          <h5>PRACTICAL MAGIC</h5>
          <p>Your mastery of elemental power lets you customize

          </ul>

          effects:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You use the Knockback maneuver, but you make a
            Reason test instead of a Might test. For this use of
            the maneuver, you can target a creature at a distance
            equal to the distance of your Hurl Element
            ability.</li>
            <li>You choose a creature within the distance of your
            Hurl Element ability and deal damage to that creature
            equal to your Reason score. The damage type can be
            acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or
            sonic.</li>
            <li>You teleport a number of squares equal to your

          <p>You can speak with and understand Animals, Plant
          Creatures, and Monstrosities, even if they don't share a
          language with you. Your ability to communicate with such
          creatures doesn't make them inherently more intelligent
          or less hostile toward you.</p>
          <p>Additionally, when you touch a living plant object,
          you can communicate with it telepathically. You can use
          words to communicate with the plant, but it communicates
          with you only by transmitting feelings and sensations
          that can't be overly specific.</p>

          can do.</p>

      <h3>1ST-LEVEL FEATURES</h3>
      <p>As a fury, you gain the following features.</p>
      <section id="primordial-aspect" class="level4">
        <h4>PRIMORDIAL ASPECT</h4>
        <p>You come from a tradition older than civilization, older
        than warfare, older than most of the world. You have
        undergone a rite of passage that revealed the building
        blocks of the timescape—the Primordial Chaos—and which left
        an aspect of the Primordial Chaos inside you. As you
        channel the rage that shapes you, you can choose a
        primordial aspect from the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Berserker:</strong> You channel your rage
          into expressions of physical might, acting as a living
          version of the forces that reshape the world. You gain
          the Lift skill.</li>
          <li><strong>Reaver:</strong> You channel your rage into
          instinct and cunning, challenging the false order of
          civilization. You gain the Hide skill.</li>
          <li><strong>Stormwight:</strong> You channel your rage
          into the form of animals and primordial storms. You gain
          the Track skill.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your choice of primordial aspect determines many of the
        features you'll gain from this class.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="rage" class="level4">
        <h4>RAGE</h4>
        <p>As the battle intensifies around you, your determination
        and anger grow, fueling a Heroic Resource called rage.</p>
        <p>Outside of combat and other dangerous situations tracked
        in turns and rounds, you have fury equal to your Victories.
        If you lose some or all of this rage outside of combat, it
        takes you 1 minute to regain it.</p>
        <p>When a combat encounter begins, you keep any rage you
        had outside of combat. At the start of each of your turns
        during combat, you gain 1d3 rage. When combat ends, you
        once again have rage equal to your Victories.</p>
      </section>

        <h4>GROWING RAGE</h4>

        of rage you have. See Aspect Features for details. The
        benefits from your growing rage last until the end of your
        turn, even if a benefit would become unavailable to you
        because of the amount of rage you spend during your
        turn.</p>

      <h3>1ST-LEVEL FEATURES</h3>
      <p>As a shadow, you gain the following features.</p>
      <section id="shadow-college" class="level4">
        <h4>SHADOW COLLEGE</h4>
        <p>Shadow colleges are secret institutions that turn
        ordinary folk into something else. Finding a college is the
        first step in a rigorous initiation process that tests the
        mettle of an applicant. Even those who make the cut often
        wash out—or are kicked out—as the master shadows who teach
        stealth, magic, and assassination to their students are
        often less than gentle in their approach.</p>
        <p>You are one of the few who has graduated from a shadow
        college, chosen from the following options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>College of Black Ash:</strong> The College of
          Black Ash founded the art of being a shadow. Its
          graduates use Black Ash sorcery to teleport around the
          battlefield in clouds of soot, and to manipulate and
          create darkness. Graduates of the college are unmatched
          in mobility. You gain the Magic skill.</li>
          <li><strong>College of Caustic Alchemy:</strong> The
          College of Caustic Alchemy teaches its students recipes
          for the acids, bombs, and poisons used in their grim
          work. Graduates of the college are exceptional assassins.
          You gain the Alchemy skill.</li>
          <li><strong>College of the Harlequin Mask:</strong>
          Graduates of the College of the Harlequin Mask learn
          illusion magic, which they use to infiltrate enemy
          strongholds and create orchestrated chaos in combat. You
          gain the Lie skill.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your choice of shadow college determines many of the
        features you'll gain from this class.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="insight" class="level4">
        <h4>INSIGHT</h4>
        <p>By observing your enemy, you learn how to use their
        weaknesses against them. You have a Heroic Resource called
        insight.</p>
        <p>Outside of combat and other dangerous situations tracked
        in turns and rounds, you have insight equal to your
        Victories. If you lose some or all of this insight outside
        of combat, it takes you 1 minute to regain it.</p>
        <p>When a combat encounter begins, you keep any insight you
        had outside of combat. At the start of each of your turns
        during combat, you gain 2 insight. You gain 1 insight
        whenever you get a tier 3 result with an attack. When
        combat ends, you once again have insight equal to your
        Victories.</p>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Effect:</strong> You coat one of your
            weapons with a harmful poison. The next creature you
            damage with an ability that uses that weapon takes
            extra poison damage equal to twice your Presence score
            or the target is weakened (EoT). You choose the effect
            when you apply the poison. The poison loses its potency

            <p><strong>Spend Insight:</strong> For each insight you

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Choose a creature of your
            size, whose size is no more than 1 greater than yours,
            and who is within 10 squares of you. Your body is
            covered in an illusion that makes you appear to be that
            creature. This illusion covers your entire body,
            including clothing and armor, and changes your voice to
            sound like the creature. While this illusion lasts, you
            gain an edge on attacks against and Presence tests made
            to interact with the creature's allies, and you don't
            provoke opportunity attacks from those allies. These
            benefits don't apply against the creature whose
            appearance you've taken on. The illusion ends when you
            harm another creature, when you and another creature
            physically interact, when you use this ability again,
            or when you end the illusion (no action required).</p>

      <h3>1ST-LEVEL FEATURES</h3>
      <p>As a tactician, you gain the following features.</p>
      <section id="tactical-doctrine" class="level4">
        <h4>TACTICAL DOCTRINE</h4>
        <p>Warfare is as old as civilization—and perhaps even
        older. As battle became ever more developed and complex,
        military leaders invented doctrine, outlining how
        combatants should be structured, used, and deployed.
        Doctrine can be learned at war colleges passing on ancient
        martial traditions, or directly through blood and sweat on
        the battlefield.</p>
        <p>You have developed a mastery of tactics of historical
        significance, letting you choose one of the following
        doctrines:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vanguard (Shock and Awe):</strong> You have
          learned the tactics and stratagems of the heroes of
          ancient history, letting you lead from the front lines of
          battle and seek victory through sheer force of will and
          personality. You gain a skill from the interpersonal
          skill group.</li>
          <li><strong>Mastermind (Grand Strategy):</strong> You
          have an encyclopedic knowledge of warfare, viewing the
          battlefield as a game board, and seeking victory by
          thinking multiple steps ahead of your opponents. You gain
          a skill from the lore skill group.</li>
          <li><strong>Insurgent (Asymmetric Warfare):</strong>
          Doing your duty, playing fair, and dying honorably in
          battle is your opponent's job. By contrast, you'll do
          whatever it takes to keep your allies alive. You gain a
          skill from the intrigue skill group.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your choice of doctrine determines many of the features
        you'll gain from this class.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="focus" class="level4">
        <h4>FOCUS</h4>
        <p>The ring of steel panics others but brings order to your
        mind, granting you a Heroic Resource called focus.</p>
        <p>Outside of combat and other dangerous situations tracked
        in turns and rounds, you have focus equal to your
        Victories. If you lose some or all of this focus outside of
        combat, it takes you 1 minute to regain it.</p>
        <p>When a combat encounter begins, you keep any focus you
        had outside of combat. At the start of each of your turns
        during combat, you gain 2 focus. If an ally gets a tier 3
        result on an attack against a target you have marked, you
        gain 1 focus. When combat ends, you once again have focus
        equal to your Victories.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="mark" class="level4">
        <h4>MARK</h4>
        <p>You know how to focus the attention of your allies as
        you push them toward victory. You have the following
        ability.</p>
        <section id="mark-1" class="level5">
          <h5>MARK</h5>
          <p>You draw your allies' attention to a specific foe—with
          devastating effect.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Ranged</li>
            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Maneuver</li>

            <li><strong>Target:</strong> 1 creature</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Effect:</strong> The target is marked by you
          until the start of your next turn. When attacking a
          marked target, you and each of your allies gains an edge
          on power rolls and deals extra damage equal to your
          Reason score.</p>
          <p><strong>Spend 1 Focus:</strong> You mark 1 additional
          creature within distance.</p>

      <section id="seize-the-opening" class="level4">
        <h4>SEIZE THE OPENING</h4>
        <p>Your ability to command your allies in combat grants you
        the following ability.</p>
        <section id="seize-the-opening-1" class="level5">
          <h5>SEIZE THE OPENING</h5>
          <p>As the battle unfolds, you tell your allies exactly
          when to strike!</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Ranged</li>
            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Action</li>
            <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Ranged 10</li>
            <li><strong>Target:</strong> 1 ally</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Effect:</strong> The target makes a signature
          attack as a free triggered action, and deals extra damage
          equal to your Reason score.</p>
          <p><strong>Spend 5 Focus:</strong> You target two allies
          instead of one.</p>

          <h5>COVERT OPERATIONS</h5>
          <p>While in your presence or working according to your
          plans, each of your allies gains an edge on tests with
          any skill from the intrigue skill group. Additionally,
          you can use the Lead skill to assist on any test made
          with a skill from the intrigue skill group. At the
          Director's discretion, you and your allies can use skills
          from the intrigue skill group to attempt research or
          reconnaissance during a negotiation instead of outside of
          negotiation.</p>

          <h5>IMPOSING ATTITUDE</h5>
          <p>You command any room you walk into. While you are
          present, each hero with you is treated as having a Renown
          2 higher than usual for the purpose of negotiations and
          influencing tests. Additionally, each hero with you has a
          double edge on tests made to stop combat and start a
          negotiation with the other side.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="i-read-your-book" class="level5">
          <h5>I READ YOUR BOOK!</h5>
          <p>Your encyclopedic knowledge of the history of battle
          lets you apply that knowledge to current challenges.
          While you are with them, any hero treats the Discover
          Lore project as one category cheaper, with projects
          seeking common lore becoming free. (See Research and
          Crafting in future packets for more information.)</p>
          <p>Additionally, if you have a reasonable amount of time
          before a combat encounter or negotiation, and you have at
          least one clue or rumor regarding the encounter, you can
          make a Reason test as a Respite activity. The following
          test results apply to a combat encounter:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>11 or lower:</strong> The Director tells
            you the number of creatures in the encounter.</li>
            <li><strong>12-16:</strong> The Director tells you the
            number and level of the creatures in the
            encounter.</li>
            <li><strong>17+:</strong> As 12-16 and when the
            encounter begins, all enemies are surprised.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The following test results apply to a negotiation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>11 or lower:</strong> The Director tells
            you three different motivations, one of which is one of
            the NPC's motivations, and the other two are not.</li>
            <li><strong>12-16:</strong> The Director tells you one
            of the NPC's motivations.</li>
            <li><strong>17+:</strong> As 12-16 and you and your
            allies gain an edge on tests made to influence NPCs
            during the negotiation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can only make this test once for each encounter
          and negotiation.</p>

        <h4>FIELD ARSENAL</h4>
        <p>You have drilled with a broad array of weapons and have
        developed techniques to optimize their use. Whenever you
        select or change your kit, you can select an additional
        martial kit and gain the benefits of both kits. (See
        Kits.)</p>
        <p>If both kits grant you the same benefit, you take one or
        the other and can't change your choice until you finish a
        Respite. (This usually means taking the higher of two
        bonuses.) You also gain access to the signature abilities
        of both kits.</p>
        <p>For example, if you take the Shining Armor and Sniper
        kits, you gain the following benefits overall:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stamina Bonus:</strong> +12</li>
          <li><strong>Stability Bonus:</strong> +1</li>
          <li><strong>Melee Weapon Damage Bonus:</strong>
          +2/+2/+2</li>
          <li><strong>Speed Bonus:</strong> +1</li>
          <li><strong>Ranged Weapon Damage Bonus:</strong>
          +0/+0/+4</li>
          <li><strong>Distance Bonus:</strong> +10</li>
          <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> When an enemy ends their
          turn adjacent to you, you can shift up to 2 squares as a
          free triggered action.</li>
          <li><strong>You also gain the use of the Protective
          Attack and Patient Shot signature
          abilities.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Kit signature abilities already have their bonuses
        applied. For example, you might take the Martial Artist
        kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +2/+2/+2,
        and the Mountain kit, which gives a melee weapon damage
        bonus of +0/+0/+4. If you choose to use the Mountain kit's
        damage bonus, then the Battle Grace signature ability from
        the Martial Artist kit would reduce its damage by −2/−2/−2,
        as it loses the bonus from the Martial Artist kit. It then
        gains the +0/+0/+4 of the Mountain kit, to deal damage of
        3/7/14 for its tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 results.</p>

    <h2>KITS</h2>
    <p>(Playtest note: This is not all the kits we imagine will be
    available in the game, but just a sampling. There might be more
    implement and weapon categories too.)</p>
    <p>The knight in shining armor. The warrior priest. The hermit
    mage. As you build your character, you can tap into these and
    many more archetypal concepts using kits. A kit is a
    combination of weapons, armor, implements, and fighting and
    spellcasting techniques that lets you personalize your
    character for battle.</p>
    <p>The game features two types of kits. A hero can take any
    kit, but some kits are better suited to specific classes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Martial kits</strong> are collections of weapons,
      armor, and related combat training. They are meant for heroes
      who primarily fight with weapons, such as furies, shadows,
      and tacticians.</li>
      <li><strong>Caster kits</strong> often include equipment, but
      are primarily methods of using magic that you meditate on.
      They are meant for heroes who primarily fight with magic
      abilities, including conduits and elementalists.</li>
    </ul>
    <section id="changing-your-kit" class="level3">
      <h3>CHANGING YOUR KIT</h3>
      <p>Your choice of kit is always flexible, and your character
      is never locked into a specific kit. If you want to change
      your kit, you can do so as a respite activity (see
      Respite).</p>
    </section>
    <section id="kit-equipment" class="level3">
      <h3>KIT EQUIPMENT</h3>
      <p>Each kit includes an armor entry. Martial kits also have a
      weapons entry, and caster kits have an implement entry. It's
      important to know what equipment a kit uses, because that
      informs your hero's appearance and story. It also determines
      the type of treasures they can wield.</p>
      <p>The description of gear in your kit is limited to broad
      categories, leaving you free to decide the specifics that
      best align with your vision of the character. For instance,
      the Guisarmier kit provides medium armor and a polearm. One
      player using this kit could wear heavy layers of hide and
      wield a longspear, while another might wear a shining
      breastplate and carry a halberd into battle.</p>
      <p>The equipment categories your kit gives you are part of
      what affects the math behind your kit's benefits, alongside
      the fighting techniques each kit provides.</p>
      <section id="customizing-equipment-appearances" class=

        <h4>CUSTOMIZING EQUIPMENT APPEARANCES</h4>
        <p>You should absolutely feel free to describe your
        equipment in a way that makes sense for the story of your
        game and hero. For instance, if your hero uses a weapon in
        the whip category as part of their kit, they could use a
        leather whip, a spiked chain, or a dagger tied to a knotted
        rope. A hero who wears heavy armor might wear a suit of
        chain mail, plate armor, or heavy wooden planks tied
        together. Your choices for equipment aren't limited just to
        the examples in this book.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="kit-armor-categories" class="level4">
        <h4>KIT ARMOR CATEGORIES</h4>
        <p>Each kit has an armor category that indicates the kind
        of protection you have while using the kit.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>None:</strong> If a kit has no armor, you can
          wear whatever clothing you like! Robes, a fashionable
          tunic and pants, or just a loincloth—it's totally up to
          you.</li>
          <li><strong>Light Armor:</strong> If a kit features light
          armor, you might wear padded cloth, leather armor, or
          even a chain shirt.</li>
          <li><strong>Medium Armor:</strong> If a kit has medium
          armor, you might wear layers of thick hides, a
          breastplate, or armor made of metal scales.</li>
          <li><strong>Heavy Armor:</strong> If a kit has heavy
          armor, then you're likely wearing metal from head to toe.
          Chain mail, ring mail, and suits of plate armor protect
          you better than any other mundane protection.</li>
          <li><strong>Shield:</strong> If a kit has a shield, then
          you wield a shield that can be any shape and made of any
          mundane material you like. The best shields have a sweet
          insignia on them, so start thinking about yours!</li>

        <h4>KIT IMPLEMENT MATERIALS</h4>
        <p>Caster kits have an implement that enhances and focuses
        a hero's magic abilities. Even a creature who doesn't use
        magic abilities can eke a bit of power from an implement by
        using the proper spellcasting style and techniques. Each
        material can boost some of a caster's magic abilities, but
        also focuses on improving a specific aspect of their magic.
        Your implement might be an amulet or a book of
        incantations, a holy symbol, orb, rod, staff, or wand, or
        any other similar item that you touch while using your
        abilities. The exact look of an implement is for you to
        decide.</p>
        <p>Each material that can be used to create an implement
        (such as bone, crystal, or metal) enhances a different
        aspect of your fighting style and magical abilities. The
        materials used to create your implement are determined by
        your kit, but you choose how much they factor into the
        implement's visual design. For example, a hero with the
        Frigid kit wields an implement made of crystal. This could
        be a crystal-tipped cane, rod, staff, or wand, or it could
        be a tome with a large crystal embedded in the cover. You
        can also include other materials in your implement, though
        they have no effect on your kit's bonuses.</p>
        <p>You can use any ability with the Magic keyword even if
        your kit doesn't have an implement, but you don't get to
        apply your kit's bonuses to that ability.</p>

          <h5>MELEE WEAPON DAMAGE BONUS</h5>
          <p>Martial kits can have a melee weapon damage bonus.
          This bonus is added to abilities with the Melee and

        <section id="bonuses-across-tiers" class="level5">
          <h5>BONUSES ACROSS TIERS</h5>
          <p>Kit damage bonuses are presented as “+X/+Y/+Z.” The X
          bonus is added to qualifying tier 1 power roll results,
          the Y bonus is added to qualifying tier 2 power roll
          results, and the Z bonus is added to qualifying tier 3
          power roll results.</p>
          <p>For example, the Shining Armor Kit has a +2/+2/+2
          melee weapon damage bonus, increasing the damage of your
          abilities with the Melee and Weapon keywords across all
          tier results. The Dancer kit has a +0/+1/+2 magic damage
          bonus, having no effect on tier 1 results, increasing the
          damage of tier 2 results by 1, and increasing the damage
          of tier 3 results by 2 for your magic abilities.</p>

      <section id="distance-bonus" class="level4">
        <h4>DISTANCE BONUS</h4>
        <p>If you have a martial kit, its distance bonus increases
        the distance of your abilities with the Ranged and Weapon
        keywords.</p>
        <p>If you have a caster kit, its distance bonus increases
        the distance of your abilities with the Magic and Ranged
        keywords.</p>
        <p>A distance bonus doesn't increase the size of any
        ability's area of effect.</p>

      </section>
      <section id="area-bonus" class="level4">
        <h4>AREA BONUS</h4>
        <p>Some caster kits have an area bonus. For all areas
        except walls, the bonus is added to all dimensions of any
        area of effect created by your magic abilities. For walls,
        the bonus is added to the number of squares the wall can
        create.</p>
        <p>For example, the conduit's Thunder of the Divine ability
        has a 4-cube area of effect, so an area bonus of +1
        increases the ability's area of effect to a 5-cube.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="mobility" class="level4">
        <h4>MOBILITY</h4>
        <p>Some martial kits grant you the Mobility trait. With
        this trait, when an enemy ends their turn adjacent to you,
        you can shift up to 2 squares as a free triggered
        action.</p>

      <h3>KIT WARDS</h3>
      <p>Each caster kit grants you a ward that is active as long
      as you are alive and not unconscious. This ward protects you
      from harm and can hinder your foes. The narrative details of
      how this ward manifests are up to you. A ward might be
      something anyone can notice, such as a glimmering field of
      energy that always surrounds you. Or it might be hidden from
      the senses of others until combat begins.</p>
      <section id="optional-rule-losing-equipment" class="level4">
        <h4>OPTIONAL RULE: LOSING EQUIPMENT</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The rules of the game expect that heroes always have
          access to their equipment. However, there may be times
          where your group wants to tell a story of heroes who are
          captured and stripped of their equipment or who find
          themselves at a masquerade where weapons need to be
          checked at the door. For those sorts of scenarios, you
          can use the following rules:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If your kit has armor and you aren't wearing or
            wielding it, then you lose your kit's bonuses to
            Stamina and stability. If you lose your shield but keep
            the rest of your armor, your Stamina decreases by 3. As
            long as you are carrying your shield, you don't lose
            its bonus to Stamina, even if you aren't actively
            wielding it.</li>
            <li>If your kit has a medium or heavy weapon that you
            aren't wielding, you lose the kit's melee damage
            bonus.</li>
            <li>If your kit has a light weapon that you aren't
            wielding, you lose the kit's melee damage, ranged
            damage, and distance bonus.</li>
            <li>If your kit has a reach weapon or whip that you
            aren't wielding, you lose the kit's melee damage and
            reach bonus.</li>
            <li>If your kit has an ensnaring weapon that you aren't
            wielding, you lose the kit's signature ability.</li>
            <li>If your kit has an implement that you aren't
            wielding, you lose the kit's speed, stability,
            distance, area, damage bonus, and ward.</li>

    <h2>COMPLICATIONS</h2>
    <p>Beyond your abilities and features, your hero might have
    something else that makes them … unusual. Perhaps you have an
    earth elemental living in your body. Or you might wield a magic
    sword that devastates enemies but feeds on your own
    vitality.</p>
    <p>A complication is an optional feature you can take to enrich
    your hero's backstory, with any complication providing you both
    a positive benefit and a negative drawback. Because
    complications are optional, check with your Director before
    taking one.</p>
    <section id="benefit-and-drawback" class="level3">
      <h3>BENEFIT AND DRAWBACK</h3>
      <p>Your complication gives your hero both a benefit and a
      drawback. Some of these benefits and drawbacks are
      mechanical, while others are narrative. The benefit and
      drawback of a complication makes your connection to the game
      deeper and more interesting, and provides hooks to let the
      Director better draw your hero into the campaign's story.</p>
      <p>Not all complication benefits and drawbacks are created
      equal, but each benefit is balanced by its drawback. If you
      have a powerful positive side to your complication, be
      prepared to have an equally influential bit of negative
      backstory as well.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="modifying-the-story" class="level3">
      <h3>MODIFYING THE STORY</h3>
      <p>You can modify the narrative of a complication to better
      fit with your vision of your character's backstory—or change
      it entirely. For instance, if you choose Devil Deal as a
      complication, you can have your hero instead make that deal
      with an archfey or an undead general!</p>
      <p>Many of the details of each complication are purposefully
      left vague, so that you can connect it to the rest of your
      backstory. If your complication took place during “an attack”
      or “an accident,” you decide the specific details of who or
      what attacked you, or what type of accident befell you.</p>

        with corrupted magic, turning you partially
        incorporeal.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per turn, you can move
        through a solid mundane object no more than 1 square thick.

        <h4>DEVIL DEAL</h4>

        tied you to that fiend's service. When you first learned of
        this deal, you were taken to the Seven Cities of Hell,
        where some of the timescape's best minds taught you the
        ways of battle or magic. The archdevil allows you to use
        these gifts as you will … until they require a favor from

    <h2>TESTS</h2>
    <p>When you want your hero to rifle through a desk and locate a
    specific document, scale a castle wall, negotiate a treaty with
    a monarch, or undertake any other activity with a chance of
    failure, you'll need to make a test to determine how successful
    you are on the task. A test is any power roll that has failure
    as an option.</p>
    <section id="when-to-make-a-test" class="level3">
      <h3>WHEN TO MAKE A TEST</h3>
      <p>The Director should ask a player to make a test only when
      the player's hero attempts a task where the consequences of
      failure are interesting or dramatic, and where failure won't
      grind the story to a halt. For example, if a hero wants to
      leap over a waist-high wall while casually walking through a
      peaceful city neighborhood, the worst case for failure is
      probably that the hero falls on their butt, takes no damage,
      and can stand up to either try again or walk around the wall.
      As such, no test is required. But if the hero were being
      chased by enemies, failing to leap over the wall means the
      pursuers can catch them, so the Director might decide to call
      for a test to determine what happens.</p>
      <p>The advancement of a story shouldn't be halted by failing
      a test. For instance, the heroes might need to know the color
      of a dwarf king's crown to solve a puzzle, with that puzzle
      opening the only entrance to a tomb they must enter to stop a
      world-ending ritual. It could be that a successful Reason
      test allows the heroes to recall that lore, but the test
      shouldn't be their only option to get the information. If the
      test fails, perhaps the heroes need to go to a flying library
      to do research, or they might be able to delve into a ruin to
      find the ancient monarch's portrait. A failed test should
      always result in a story becoming more interesting, not in
      the action coming to an end.</p>
      <section id="it-just-works" class="level4">
        <h4>IT JUST WORKS!</h4>
        <p>When a hero attempts to solve a task that normally
        requires a test with clever, outside-the-box thinking, the
        Director can instead decide that no test is required and
        the attempt automatically works! For example, if a hero who
        wants to climb a wall first covers their hands and feet in
        giant strands of sticky spider webs, the Director might
        decide that they can climb up the wall without needing to
        make a test.</p>
        <p>That said, such clever ideas often work for free the
        first time, but the Director could decide they require
        tests if they are used again.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="how-to-make-a-test" class="level3">
      <h3>HOW TO MAKE A TEST</h3>
      <p>Each test has the following steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Director decides that a hero's actions call for a
        test and asks the hero's player to make a power roll using
        an appropriate characteristic (see Characteristics and
        Tests). The Director then selects a difficulty for the
        power roll, either secretly or publicly (see Test
        Difficulty).</li>
        <li>The player makes the power roll. If the character has a
        skill that applies to the test (see Skills), they gain a +2
        bonus to the roll.</li>
        <li>The player reports the result, and the Director
        interprets the success or failure of the roll.</li>
      </ul>
      <section id="characteristics-and-tests" class="level4">
        <h4>CHARACTERISTICS AND TESTS</h4>
        <p>When you describe a task you want your hero to undertake
        and the Director determines that a test is necessary, they
        then determine which characteristic the test uses based on
        the nature of the task. For instance, if you're scaling a
        wall, the Director could ask for a Might test to determine
        how far and how quickly you're able to climb. If you're
        attempting to plead your innocence in court for a murder
        you didn't commit, the Director might ask for a Presence
        test if you're attempting to win over the jury with your
        personality, or a Reason test if you're laying out a
        logical argument to support your innocence.</p>
        <p>Though the Director can decide to call for tests in any
        circumstances, a number of tasks that heroes routinely
        undertake are commonly set up as tests.</p>
        <section id="might-tests" class="level5">
          <h5>MIGHT TESTS</h5>
          <p>You make a Might test whenever a risky task calls for
          the use of physical strength. Might tests are most often
          used for breaking down doors and other structures,
          hurling heavy objects, pulling your body up a sheer wall,
          swimming against a mighty current, and other feats of
          physical power.</p>

          for the use of your physical coordination and nimbleness.
          Agility tests are most often used for tumbling, sneaking,
          picking locks, and engaging in sleight of hand.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="reason-tests" class="level5">
          <h5>REASON TESTS</h5>
          <p>You make a Reason test whenever you attempt a risky
          task that requires the use of your mental acumen and
          education, formal or otherwise. Reason tests are most
          often used to recall lore, deduce information based on
          clues, complete a puzzle, forge counterfeit items or
          documents, break a code, convince others of a logical
          argument, or make an estimation.</p>

        <section id="intuition-tests" class="level5">
          <h5>INTUITION TESTS</h5>
          <p>You make an Intuition test whenever you attempt a
          risky task that requires the use of your powers of
          observation and instinct. Intuition tests are most often
          used to notice hidden creatures or details, discern
          another person's motivations or honesty, calm and
          reassure others, and train animals.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="presence-tests" class="level5">
          <h5>PRESENCE TESTS</h5>
          <p>You make a Presence test whenever you attempt a risky

        <h4>INFLUENCING PLAYER CHARACTER ACTIONS WITH TESTS</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Tests can't be used by NPCs or PCs to influence the
          actions of PCs. Many players feel that their agency is
          taken away if they're compelled to jump into a pile of
          gold filled with hidden scorpions because an NPC
          convinced them to do so with a Presence test. For most
          players, it's not fun to be in control of a single hero
          and lose some of that control.</p>
          <p>Instead, Directors should do their level best to have
          an NPC suggest that a character dive headlong into the
          gold like a billionaire duck, then let the player decide
          what their character does. Similarly, a Director might
          decide that one player character can't make an Intuition
          test to discern another PC's motivations or honesty.</p>
          <p>That said, if everyone in your gaming group decides to
          lift one or more of these restrictions after talking
          about it, go for it! There's no wrong way to play as long
          as everyone is having fun. The MCDM Safety Toolkit
          (available for download at <a href=
          "https://mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit">https://mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit</a>)
          discusses how to talk about potentially problematic
          topics such as limiting character agency at your
          table.</p>

      </section>
      <section id="test-difficulty" class="level4">
        <h4>TEST DIFFICULTY</h4>
        <p>The Director decides how difficult a task that requires
        a test is: easy, medium, or hard. If a task seems as though
        it's easier than easy, then no test is necessary. The hero
        simply accomplishes the task. If the task seems harder than
        hard, then the Director is free to decide that it's
        impossible to complete with a test.</p>
        <p>On a test-by-test basis, the Director can share the
        difficulty of a task before the player makes the test,
        which makes interpreting the result faster at the table.
        The Director can also keep the test's difficulty secret
        until after the player rolls the test, for dramatic
        effect.</p>

        <h4>TEST OUTCOMES</h4>
        <p>Depending on a test's difficulty and the result of the

        the following outcomes.</p>
        <section id="failure-with-a-consequence" class="level5">
          <h5>FAILURE WITH A CONSEQUENCE</h5>
          <p>If you fail a test and incur a consequence, you don't
          do what you set out to do—in addition to which, you
          suffer an impactful setback. The Director determines the
          exact nature of the consequence, which is typically
          related to the specific task. For instance, if a hero
          suffers a consequence while trying to climb a wall, they
          might make it halfway up the wall and then fall, taking
          damage and landing prone. A hero trying to sneak by
          cultists might be spotted by those foes, who immediately
          attack. If a consequence strikes when a hero attempts to
          bribe a prison guard, the guard might decide to arrest
          the hero or lead them into a trap. If a hero suffers a
          consequence on a Reason test made to recall lore about
          the king's favorite meal, they might confuse it for a
          dish to which the monarch is deathly allergic.</p>
          <p>Not all consequences need to be immediate or apparent.
          For example, a hero might fail with a consequence on a
          test made to cheat at a high-stakes game of cards with a
          noble. The failure means that the noble notices, but the
          Director decides that the noble doesn't say anything.
          This consequence isn't made apparent until later in the
          evening, when the noble has guards surround the hero and
          take the cheater down to the dungeon for stacking the
          deck.</p>
          <p>Common consequences for failing a test include the
          following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Making an NPC so upset that they storm off, or
            betray, attack, or otherwise attempt to harm you</li>
            <li>Drawing the attention of a group of foes</li>
            <li>Triggering a trap or hazard that captures or
            significantly harms you or an ally</li>
            <li>Breaking an important piece of equipment that is
            difficult to replace or repair</li>
            <li>Thinking you know something that you don't</li>
            <li>Getting stuck in a situation that must be resolved
            with a negotiation or a montage test that you didn't
            need to make before</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In lieu of other consequences, the Director has the
          option to gain 2 additional Villain Power (VP), a
          resource their creatures use in combat, at the start of
          the next combat encounter.</p>

        <section id="failure" class="level5">
          <h5>FAILURE</h5>
          <p>If you fail a test without incurring a consequence,
          you simply don't do what you set out to do. If you're
          attempting to climb a wall, you find no purchase. If
          you're attempting to recall lore, you can't remember the
          desired facts. If you're attempting to bribe a guard,
          they don't take the bait.</p>
          <p>When you get this result, the Director can decide that
          there might still be a small penalty for failure,
          depending on the circumstances of the test. This penalty
          shouldn't be as harsh as rolling a failure with a
          consequence, though. For instance, a hero who gets this
          result on an Agility test made to sneak by a group of
          cultists might draw the attention of one cultist with
          their failure. Now that cultist is coming to investigate,
          but they haven't raised the alarm… yet.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="success-with-a-consequence" class="level5">
          <h5>SUCCESS WITH A CONSEQUENCE</h5>
          <p>If you succeed on a test and incur a consequence, you
          do what you set out to do, but with an added cost. You
          might succeed in climbing up a wall, but the surface of
          the wall crumbles and becomes unstable as you do, making
          the climb more difficult for the ally ascending after
          you. When trying to sneak by a cultist, you successfully
          do so, but you leave footprints or other evidence of
          trespassing behind that someone will eventually find. If
          you attempt to bribe a guard to let you sneak into a
          prison, the guard lets you in—but then demands that you
          hand over a gemstone you need for an important crafting
          project before they let you out.</p>
          <p>Just like failure with a consequence, the consequences
          accompanying success don't need to be immediately
          apparent. In lieu of other consequences, the Director has
          the option to gain 2 additional VP at the start of the
          next combat encounter.</p>
          <p>Sometimes when a hero rolls a failure without a
          consequence, the Director can offer to let them succeed
          with a consequence. Likewise, a hero who rolls a success
          with a consequence might be given a chance to fail
          without a consequence if doing so is the better option.
          For instance, when a hero rolls a 10 on an easy Might
          test to break down a locked door, that's a failure. But
          the Director could offer the player the choice of either
          not breaking down the door, or breaking down the door and
          losing 1d6 Stamina as they get injured in the effort.</p>

        <section id="success" class="level5">
          <h5>SUCCESS</h5>
          <p>If you succeed on a test without consequence or
          reward, you simply achieve whatever you set out to do.
          You climb that wall, sneak by those cultists, or bribe
          that guard just like you planned it. Smooth.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="success-with-a-reward" class="level5">
          <h5>SUCCESS WITH A REWARD</h5>
          <p>If you succeed on a test with a reward, you accomplish
          whatever you set out to do. But you also gain a little
          something extra, in the form of momentum or luck that
          makes the immediate future easier for you or your
          friends. The Director determines your reward, which is
          most often related to the task at hand. For instance, if
          you succeed with a reward while climbing a wall, you
          might find a ladder at the top that you can lower so any
          allies climbing after you can do so without needing to
          make a test. A hero trying to sneak by cultists who
          succeeds with a reward might then be able to dose the
          cultists' nearby water barrel with sleeping poison as
          they pass by unseen. Succeeding with a reward while
          bribing a prison guard could mean that the guard will
          unlock a door for you in addition to forgetting you were
          ever there.</p>
          <p>As with consequences, the reward that comes with a
          success doesn't need to be immediate or apparent. For
          example, a hero succeeds with a reward on an easy test
          made to cheat at a high-stakes game of cards with a
          noble. Not only does the hero win the game, but the
          Director decides that their reward comes from a servant
          watching the game who's impressed with the character's
          performance. After the game, the servant approaches the
          hero, offering a Flying Potion from the noble's private
          stash in congratulations and admiration.</p>
          <p>Some common rewards accompanying success on a test
          include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Automatically accomplishing a related follow-up
            task that would normally require a test</li>
            <li>Allowing an ally engaged in the same task to
            accomplish the task without needing to make the test
            too</li>
            <li>Obtaining a consumable supernatural item or useful
            piece of mundane equipment</li>
            <li>Learning a piece of helpful information</li>
            <li>Impressing or ingratiating yourself with someone
            who grants you a small favor</li>
            <li>Noticing a hidden danger well before it strikes,
            giving you time to avoid or prepare for it</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In lieu of other rewards, the Director can also decide
          that a hero who succeeds on a test with a reward earns
          the players a hero token (see Hero Tokens).</p>

          <h5>OPTION: LET PLAYERS PITCH CONSEQUENCES AND
          REWARDS</h5>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Coming up with consequences and rewards for tests
            can be a big part of the fun for many Directors, but
            even the best of us occasionally run low on ideas.
            That's why the game gives the default option of
            consequences and rewards in the form of Villain Power
            and hero tokens. However, if you're a Director who
            prefers narrative consequences and rewards, consider
            asking the players to pitch you different consequences
            and rewards when they make a test. You can reject, add
            to, or modify their ideas as you see fit. Players who
            take this option should understand that they need to
            pitch real consequences when they suffer one, and not
            minor rewards disguised as consequences.</p>

        <p>The amount of time required for a task involving a test
        is determined by the Director. A task such as recalling
        lore with a Reason test might take no time at all. Ducking
        behind a barrel to hide with an Agility test might require
        a maneuver or an action, while tracking a band of voiceless
        talkers through the World Below could take hours or even

        For instance, if you attempt an Agility test to pick a lock

        you get some better lockpicks, oil the lock, have someone
        demonstrate how to pick a similar lock, and so on.</p>

    <section id="heroes-make-tests" class="level3">
      <h3>HEROES MAKE TESTS</h3>
      <p>If a hero attempts to sneak by an enemy guard unnoticed,
      should the hero make an Agility test to sneak, or should the
      guard make an Intuition test to catch the hero in the act? If
      a cultist lies to a hero about the location of a secret
      temple, does the cultist roll a Presence test to conceal the
      truth, or does the hero roll an Intuition test to discern the
      cultist's honesty?</p>
      <p>Unless the rules state otherwise, heroes make tests and
      NPCs do not. Heroes are the stars of the story, and the
      consequences and rewards of tests have longer-lasting
      implications for them. There are exceptions to this rule, of
      course. If a hero travels with an NPC retainer or companion,
      that NPC would almost certainly make tests too. But for the
      most part, NPCs working against the heroes never need to make
      tests.</p>
      <p>To quickly assess the difficulty of a task and the test
      made to attempt it, the Director can use the following
      guidelines (though these are not hard and fast rules):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Easy Test</strong>: A test is easy if only one
        creature opposes the hero, and that opposed creature would
        have a lower bonus to their test roll for the task than the
        hero does. If a hero with an Agility score of 2 attempts to
        sneak by a guard with an Intuition score of 0, the test is
        easy.</li>
        <li><strong>Moderate Test</strong>: A test is moderate if
        multiple creatures oppose the hero and those creatures
        would have lower bonuses to their test rolls than the hero,
        or if only one creature opposes the hero and has the same
        test bonus as the hero.</li>
        <li><strong>Hard Test</strong>: A test is hard if an
        opposed creature would have a higher bonus to their test
        roll than the hero, or if multiple creatures with the same
        test bonus as the hero oppose the hero.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The failure consequences of opposed actions are some of
      the easiest to create on the fly. Fail to hide from someone,
      and they see you. Fail to lie to someone, and they catch your
      duplicity. Fail to arm wrestle someone for a free ale, and
      you're picking up the tab. The consequence is that the
      opposition bests the hero.</p>
      <section id="npcs-roll-for-deceptive-tasks" class="level4">
        <h4>NPCS ROLL FOR DECEPTIVE TASKS</h4>
        <p>At times, a hero and an NPC might oppose each other in a
        scenario where the Director chooses for the NPC to make a
        test instead of a player. This occurs when an NPC
        undertakes an action the heroes aren't aware of or aren't
        seeking actively to notice. By having the NPC roll in these
        scenarios, the Director can keep secret the fact that the
        task is happening, as well as its outcome.</p>
        <p>For example, if an assassin attempts to ambush the
        heroes while they sit around a campfire without anyone
        keeping watch for danger, the assassin makes an Agility
        test to sneak up on the heroes unnoticed. The Director
        rolls and doesn't reveal the result until the heroes
        actually realize someone is approaching their camp. If the
        assassin fails the test, the heroes notice immediately as
        their assailant loudly steps on a twig. If the assassin
        succeeds, the heroes don't notice until the assailant is
        right on top of them. But if any player had said that their
        hero was on the lookout for danger, that hero would make an
        Intuition test instead.</p>
        <p>An NPC might also make a Presence test if they lie to
        the heroes, as long as the heroes have no reason to believe
        the character would be deceptive. You'll know if the heroes
        are wary in that way, because the players will ask if they
        can make a test to discern the NPC's honesty.</p>
        <p>The difficulty of the NPC's test can be modified by the
        skills and characteristics of the heroes they attempt to
        deceive, in the same way NPC statistics can modify a hero's
        test difficulty.</p>
        <p>As an optional rule, the Director is also free to ask
        the heroes to make a reactive test to a deceptive NPC
        action instead (see <em>Reactive Tests</em>) whenever they
        see fit.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="optional-rule-opposed-power-rolls" class=
      "level4">
        <h4>OPTIONAL RULE: OPPOSED POWER ROLLS</h4>
        <p>In the very rare occurrence that two or more heroes are
        in conflict with each other in a way that requires them to
        make tests, the Director can have all the heroes involved
        make a test. The hero with the highest result on their
        power roll wins. You can't earn a reward as part of these
        opposed power rolls, and they don't follow the typical
        difficulty structure or have three different tiers of
        possible outcomes.</p>
        <p>For example, if your hero attempts to sneak by an allied
        hero, you would make an Agility test opposed by the player
        of the other character making an Intuition test. If your
        hero gets the higher result, you sneak by without the other
        hero noticing. If the other hero gets a higher result, they
        catch you in the act of sneaking. If multiple sneaking
        heroes attempt to get by multiple heroes on the lookout for
        sneaks, then each character makes a test and all the
        results are compared to determine which heroes on guard
        notice which sneaking heroes.</p>
        <p>In the event of a tie in an opposed test, the state of
        the scene doesn't change. In the previous example, a tie
        means that if a hero on guard duty didn't know a sneaking
        hero was there, then the guard hero remains oblivious. If
        the guard did know the sneak was out there somewhere and
        the sneak is trying to avoid being noticed, a tie means
        that the guard still knows the sneak is there.</p>
        <p>The Director can also use opposed power rolls when
        heroes face off against important NPCs using tests.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="reactive-tests" class="level3">
      <h3>REACTIVE TESTS</h3>
      <p>At certain times when a hero isn't engaged in overcoming a
      task, the Director might ask the player of the hero to make a
      test without context, explaining the test only after the
      power roll is made. This often happens when a hero has a
      chance of knowing or noticing something of significance that
      the player doesn't know to look for or ask about.</p>
      <p>Reactive tests are typically made in the following
      circumstances, though the Director can call for them in any
      appropriate scenario:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hidden Environmental Features</strong>: The
        Director asks for an Intuition test to notice a secret
        door, a hidden trap, or some other disguised environmental
        feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Hidden Monsters</strong>: The Director calls
        for an Intuition test to notice a hidden monster (or they
        could use the rules in <em>NPCs Roll for Deceptive
        Tasks</em>).</li>
        <li><strong>Hidden Motives</strong>: The Director can ask
        for an Intuition test during a conversation to gauge how
        well a hero can read an NPC, judging whether they're lying,
        withholding information, or concealing an emotional
        response. (The Director could also use the rules in
        <em>NPCs Roll for Deceptive Tasks</em>.)</li>
        <li><strong>Recall Lore</strong>: The Director might ask a
        hero to make a Reason test when dealing with a new object,
        a piece of information, or an event to see what history or
        details the hero might already know about it.</li>
      </ul>
      <section id="directors-option-secret-reactive-tests" class=

        <h5>DIRECTOR'S OPTION: SECRET REACTIVE TESTS</h5>
        <p>Some Directors prefer to make the power rolls for
        reactive tests for the heroes rather than asking the
        players to do so. This allows the Director to make the
        rolls when appropriate for hidden objects, creatures,
        motivations, and information without tipping off the
        players that there is information to be gained. Having the
        Director roll requires the Director to have everyone's
        characteristics and skills written down (whether physically
        or digitally) for easy reference.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="skills-1" class="level3">
      <h3>SKILLS</h3>
      <p>(Playtest note: Currently, some skills are more useful
      than others. This is likely going to be the case for a while,
      since the game isn't completed yet. There are also certain
      skills that will always be more useful in a particular type
      of campaign. This is called out in the “Are All Skills
      Equal?” sidebar.)</p>
      <p>Skills represent the different specializations a hero has
      outside of attacking, defending, and using their ancestry
      features, class features, and equipment. Whenever you make a
      test, having a particular skill associated with the test
      increases your chance of success.</p>
      <section id="applying-skills" class="level4">
        <h4>APPLYING SKILLS</h4>
        <p>If you have a skill that applies to a test you make, you
        gain a +2 bonus to the test. For instance, if your hero has
        the Hide skill, you have a +2 bonus to any test you make
        that involves hiding yourself. This might include an
        Agility test to hide behind a barrel, or a Presence test to
        disappear into a crowd.</p>
        <p>Unless the Director deems otherwise, you can make a
        skill test even when you don't have the appropriate skill.
        This means you simply make the test using the typical
        characteristic but without the +2 bonus the skill grants.
        You can't apply more than one skill to a test.</p>
        <section id="mixing-characteristics-and-skills" class=
        "level5">
          <h5>MIXING CHARACTERISTICS AND SKILLS</h5>
          <p>The bonuses from characteristics and the +2 from
          skills are separate and can apply to the same roll.
          Although certain skills are often paired with one
          characteristic more than others, a skill can apply to any
          characteristic test that makes sense. The Director has
          the final say on which characteristic is used to complete
          a task and can call for a different characteristic based
          on the circumstances.</p>
          <p>For example, intimidating someone with a purely verbal
          threat is a Presence test. But if a player describes
          their character tearing a log in half with their bare
          hands to intimidate a foe, the Director is likely to call
          for a Might test instead. The Intimidate skill applies to
          both tests. In the same way, scaling the side of a
          building is covered by a Might test, but if a hero does a
          series of leaps from one balcony to another to reach a
          roof, the Director could call for an Agility test
          instead. The Climb skill applies to both of these
          tests.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section id="many-specific-skills" class="level4">
        <h4>MANY SPECIFIC SKILLS</h4>
        <p>This game includes a big list of skills, and each is
        fairly specific. For example, instead of one Athletics
        skill that covers climbing, jumping, swimming, and lifting
        heavy objects, your character might use separate Climb,
        Jump, Lift, and Swim skills. Instead of a Thievery skill
        that covers picking locks, picking pockets, and disabling
        traps, the game has three skills: Pick Lock, Pick Pocket,
        and Sabotage.</p>
        <p>We made the decision to have a lot of specific skills
        based on our design goals. First, having skills this
        specific means that you will frequently make tests that
        don't use one of your character's skills and simply apply a
        characteristic. By not having a few broader skills, it
        means that having a character who covers the spread of
        every skill is actually impossible. Luckily, the math of
        the game doesn't require you to have a skill to have a
        decent chance of success on a test. That means heroes can
        attempt tasks without the help of a skill just because
        someone needs to do it, and that is pretty darn heroic!</p>
        <p>Since players don't need to be worried about their
        characters covering a wide spread of skills, they're free
        to choose the skills they think fit their heroes best and
        are the most fun to work with. In this way, you can get
        pretty specific with the hero you want to make. Maybe
        you're thinking about an elementalist who has a gymnastic
        background in jumping and tumbling, and who also studied
        religion and blacksmithing. You can make that in our game!
        Having a specific backstory is part of cinematic
        storytelling.</p>
        <p>Our rules for skills allow for them to be flexibly
        applied to any test that is appropriate for the skill. This
        encourages clever thinking. A player can ask the Director,
        “I want to impress the duke with a story about how I
        ascended the sheer Cliffs of Azgahnan. Can I use my Climb
        skill to get a +2 bonus to my Presence test?” That's great!
        Getting creative like that is a lot of fun. It paints a
        visual picture and it's tactical thinking! However, if the
        skills in a game are too broad in the kinds of activities
        they represent, that sometimes encourages players to find a
        way to apply the same skill over and over again with as
        many tests as possible. This isn't fun for anyone, and
        doesn't make a very compelling story.</p>

        <h4>SKILL GROUPS</h4>
        <p>Skills are broken down into five groups: crafting,
        exploration, interpersonal, intrigue, and lore.</p>
        <section id="for-the-director-make-your-own-skills" class=

          <h5>FOR THE DIRECTOR: MAKE YOUR OWN SKILLS</h5>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Directors should feel free to make their own skills
            that they feel are relevant and useful to their
            campaigns and adventures. For instance, the game
            doesn't have a Brewing skill for brewing ale or a
            Painting skill for making art because those aren't
            tasks that typically come up or require a test in a
            game about fighting monsters and saving the world.
            However, a Director could decide that their campaign
            involves poisoned barrels of ale and large amounts of
            counterfeit art, and that adding these two new skills
            to the game would make it more fun for the players. The
            Director simply needs to pick a group for these new
            skills—in this case, crafting makes sense. They then
            let the players know that they can swap out any
            crafting skill they have for these new skills.</p>

          <h5>CRAFTING SKILLS</h5>
          <p>Skills from the crafting skill group are used in the
          creation and appraisal of goods and for jury-rigging
          contraptions. They are especially useful during rests and
          downtime.</p>
          <p>Rewards for tests made with crafting skills typically
          include having leftover rare material used in the
          creation process, knowing a buyer willing to pay extra
          for goods or items you're appraising, or making a
          jury-rigged device so amazing that it lasts for more uses
          than it should.</p>
          <p>Failure consequences for tests made with crafting
          skills typically include wasting rare materials used in
          the creation process, greatly overestimating or
          underestimating an item's value, and poorly jury-rigging
          a contraption so that it harms people (or at least the
          wrong people).</p>

          <h5>LORE SKILLS</h5>
          <p>Skills from the lore skill group are used to research
          and recall specific information. They are especially
          useful during rests and downtime.</p>
          <p>Rewards for tests made with lore skills typically
          include learning an extra piece of useful
          information.</p>
          <p>Failure consequences for tests made with lore skills
          typically include learning an incorrect piece of
          information that seems useful, but which actually makes
          things worse or wastes time. (It's fun to roleplay these
          sorts of moments, so lean in!) Alternatively, the
          Director can make medium and hard lore tests for each
          hero in secret and let the players know the narrative
          outcome without revealing the result of the dice.</p>

          <h5>ARE ALL SKILLS EQUAL?</h5>
          <blockquote>
            <p>This game has a big list of skills, and it's
            impossible for us or anyone else to know in advance
            which will be most useful during a campaign. For
            instance, the Swim skill might be used constantly
            during a campaign that takes place on the ocean and has
            heroes exploring underwater ruins, but it won't come up
            as much in a campaign that takes place entirely in a
            vast desert. The Psionics skill might come up a lot in
            a campaign where voiceless talkers are the main foes,
            and Magic might be more useful in a game where the
            heroes take on a circle of evil wizards.</p>
            <p>If you're worried about whether a skill you'd like
            to take will be useful, discuss your skill list with
            the Director after you create a hero. At the Director's
            discretion, you can swap out any skill you have with
            any other skill in the same group.</p>

    <section id="assist-a-test" class="level3">
      <h3>ASSIST A TEST</h3>
      <p>You can attempt to assist another creature with a test
      they make, provided you have a skill that applies to the
      test, the other creature isn't using that same skill on the
      test, and you can describe how your character helps to the
      Director's satisfaction. In other words, your attempt to help
      has to make sense, and you have to bring some useful
      expertise to the table. Helping another creature sneak by
      shouting encouragement at them isn't going to make them
      stealthier.</p>
      <p>When you attempt to assist another creature, make an easy
      test using the skill you choose, and with a characteristic
      chosen by the Director based on the action you take to help.
      The outcome of that test determines the bonus applied to the
      test you're assisting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>11 or lower</strong>: You get in the way or
        make things worse. The creature takes a bane on their
        test.</li>
        <li><strong>12–16</strong>: Your help grants the other
        creature an edge on their test.</li>
        <li><strong>17+</strong>: Your help gives the other
        creature a double edge on their test.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, if you want to use the Flirt skill to help
      another hero pick a jailor's pocket, the Director might ask
      you to make a Presence test using Flirt. The outcome of that
      test determines the bonus you provide to the other hero's
      Agility test to pick the pocket.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="group-tests" class="level3">
      <h3>GROUP TESTS</h3>
      <p>Whenever two or more heroes attempt to overcome a single,
      simple task together that calls for them to make the same
      test, the Director can call for a group test. For example, if
      several heroes are all attempting to climb the outside of a
      tower at the same time, giving each other boosts and advice,
      they could be asked to make a Might group test. If a group of
      heroes attempt to sneak by a sleeping ogre, they might make
      an Agility group test.</p>
      <section id="group-test-difficulty" class="level4">
        <h4>GROUP TEST DIFFICULTY</h4>
        <p>The Director determines the difficulty of a group test
        the same way they do for individual tests. Group tests can
        be easy, medium, or hard.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="making-a-group-test" class="level4">
        <h4>MAKING A GROUP TEST</h4>
        <p>Each hero participating in the group test makes the test
        individually as usual, but the Director waits until all the
        tests have been made to interpret the results. A hero who
        is participating in the group test can't assist another
        hero participating in the test.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="group-test-outcome" class="level4">
        <h4>GROUP TEST OUTCOME</h4>
        <p>When interpreting the outcome of a group test, the
        Director first determines if the task succeeded or not
        before figuring out rewards and consequences. If half or
        more of the heroes making the group test succeed, then the
        group test succeeds. Otherwise, the group test fails.</p>
        <p>If the heroes succeeded and half or more of them
        obtained a reward from the test, the Director gives the
        group a collective reward and ignores any consequences
        incurred in the test. This collective reward should be
        equivalent to earning two individual rewards. In fact, it
        could be two consumable items, juicy pieces of information,
        or hero tokens. However, it could also be something more
        tailored to the task. For instance, if the heroes earn a
        collective reward while sneaking through the camp of an
        enemy army, the Director might allow them to sabotage a
        bunch of war engines or steal a few horses on their way
        out.</p>
        <p>If the heroes failed the group test and more than half
        of them incurred a consequence as a result, the Director
        gives the group a collective consequence and ignores any
        earned rewards. This collective consequence should affect
        everyone. An easy option is for the stress of failing the
        test to cause each hero to take a bane on their next power
        roll or for the Director to gain 2 VP per hero at the start
        of the next combat encounter, but the consequence could
        also be tailored to the task. For instance, if the heroes
        fail in their attempt to sneak through the camp of an enemy
        army, they're spotted and the camp immediately goes on
        alert as waves of enemies attack them.</p>
        <p>If fewer than half the heroes get a consequence or
        reward on their individual tests, then the group test
        simply succeeds or fails.</p>

    <section id="montage-tests" class="level3">
      <h3>MONTAGE TESTS</h3>
      <p>When a group of heroes works together over time to
      accomplish a common goal that requires more than a single
      characteristic, the Director can call for a montage test.
      Such tests typically take place over a prolonged period and
      focus on collective or shared activities. Navigating a vast
      desert, convincing farmers to rise up against a tyrannical
      leader, and performing a ritual to open a magically sealed
      gate can all be accomplished with montage tests.</p>
      <p>In a montage test, the players take turns making tests as
      their characters tackle a task together in a montage test
      round. Each hero has a chance to make a test (or to assist
      another hero's test) intended to influence the outcome of the
      task (see Assist a Test).</p>
      <p>A hero can also spend their turn using an item, ability,
      or other option they have available that they believe can
      help in the montage test. For example, if a group of heroes
      wants to cross an ocean on a sailing ship before a storm
      begins, one hero might make use of a magic fan that creates
      wind to keep the sails full day and night. The Director
      decides that this clever action gives the heroes 2 automatic
      successes in the montage test, with no individual tests
      necessary (see Total Successes and Failures).</p>
      <p>Once a hero makes a test, assists with a test, or uses an
      ability or other option, they can't do anything else as part
      of the montage test until each other hero involved in the
      montage test does so as well. A hero can also choose to do
      nothing, most often if they have no one to assist and fear
      that their actions might make the situation worse (see
      Montage Test Outcomes). Once every hero has had a chance to
      act, the montage test round ends and a new one begins.</p>
      <section id="time-and-stakes" class="level4">
        <h4>TIME AND STAKES</h4>
        <p>As the name suggests, montage tests create a kind of
        cinematic montage in the action of the game. A montage test
        can take place over the course of several hours or days,
        with each individual test or other activity set up as a
        brief vignette within the montage, and starring one of the
        heroes. Combat encounters, negotiations, and other
        challenges and scenes can break up a montage test (see
        Sample Montage Test below).</p>
        <p>The Director should deploy montage tests only when the
        players are engaged in overcoming a goal that has stakes
        for the story and some sort of pressure, such as a looming
        deadline or impending harm. A montage test is great for a
        race to get to another location before an enemy army does,
        a chase to escape or catch up to a foe, weathering a
        hazard, preparing a village for war, or similar activities.
        Low- or no-stakes activities such as travel through a
        forest with no time pressure, or training during a respite
        to use a new kit, can be narrated in montage style, but
        they don't require a montage test.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="director-sets-the-scene" class="level4">
        <h4>DIRECTOR SETS THE SCENE</h4>
        <p>At the start of a montage test, the Director should
        describe the scenario underlying the task at hand, and the
        various challenges the heroes might face as they attempt to
        collectively accomplish it. For example, if the heroes are
        attempting to chase down a pickpocket through a crowded
        market, the Director might talk about the throngs of
        innocent people blocking the way forward, obscuring the
        characters' vision, and making noise that complicates
        attempts to hear the thief's nimble footsteps. There are
        also traveling carts to dodge, the speed and dexterity of
        the pursued character to contend with, and a pack of stray
        dogs who chase after anyone who sprints through the market.
        Describing these obstacles gives the heroes ideas about
        what they're trying to overcome as they attempt to achieve
        their goals.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="individual-tests-in-montage-tests" class=
      "level4">
        <h4>INDIVIDUAL TESTS IN MONTAGE TESTS</h4>
        <p>The difficulty of each individual test in a montage test
        is set by the Director and can vary from test to test. For
        instance, if the heroes are preparing the defenses of a
        village threatened by a band of approaching raiders, the
        Director might decide that a character who wants to dig a
        trench around the village needs to make an easy Might test.
        Another hero wants to train the untested farmers of the
        village in the ways of war, and the Director decides this
        is a hard Reason test.</p>
        <p>The same rules and guidelines that apply to all
        individual tests apply here. If a hero has a clever,
        out-of-the-box idea that the Director thinks should
        automatically succeed without rolling dice, it does. If the
        circumstances of the test should grant an edge or a bane,
        they do. Individual test outcomes shouldn't halt the
        story.</p>
        <p>The Director should couch each success or failure as it
        relates to the overall goal of the montage test. If the
        heroes are trying to reach an ancient temple, failing a
        Might test to ford a river in their path doesn't mean they
        don't cross the river and are stuck on the other side. But
        it could mean that failing to cross the river in a timely
        manner gives a rival group of villains the chance to beat
        the party to the temple.</p>
        <p>The rewards and consequences of individual tests made
        during a montage test should be handled on an individual
        basis. The Director can use the default additional VP in
        the next combat encounter for consequences and hero tokens
        for rewards to keep the montage moving.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="cant-use-the-same-skill-twice" class="level4">
        <h4>CAN'T USE THE SAME SKILL TWICE</h4>
        <p>An individual character can't use the same skill more
        than once in a montage test. Though multiple heroes can use
        the same skill, a test or an assist with a specific skill
        represents each characters' entire contribution to the
        montage test with that skill. At the Director's discretion,
        this restriction can be lifted for prolonged montage tests,
        or for montage tests that are limited in scope and have
        only a small number of skills that apply to them.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="new-challenges-for-each-test" class="level4">
        <h4>NEW CHALLENGES FOR EACH TEST</h4>
        <p>In general, when a hero makes a test as part of a
        montage test, they should choose new obstacles to overcome
        that haven't already been tackled as part of the test. If
        the heroes are chasing a thief through the marketplace and
        one of them has already distracted the pack of stray dogs
        with a deft hand and a piece of meat, additional tests made
        to distract the animals don't count toward the result of
        the montage test.</p>
        <p>When it fits the scenario, the Director can adjust this
        restriction. If part of a montage test involves searching
        for people trapped in a burning building, the Director is
        likely to allow multiple tests to fight or avoid the fire,
        since this will happen throughout the montage test, not
        just once.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="director-can-introduce-more-challenges" class=
      "level4">
        <h4>DIRECTOR CAN INTRODUCE MORE CHALLENGES</h4>
        <p>During a montage test, a Director can introduce new
        challenges for the heroes to face. While attempting to run
        out of a burning building from the top floor, the
        characters might discover that by the time they reach the
        second floor, beams are starting to fall and glass windows
        are exploding as the structure begins to collapse. These
        new challenges can be incorporated into the tests the
        heroes subsequently make.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="total-successes-and-failures" class="level4">
        <h4>TOTAL SUCCESSES AND FAILURES</h4>
        <p>The Director or another player will track the total
        number of successes and failures the heroes earn during a
        montage test. Every montage test has a <strong>success
        limit</strong> and a <strong>failure limit</strong>. When
        the number of successful tests equals the success limit,
        the montage test ends and the heroes achieve total success
        (see Montage Test Outcomes). The montage test can also end
        when the number of failed tests equals the failure limit,
        and the heroes suffer total failure.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="limited-rounds" class="level4">
        <h4>LIMITED ROUNDS</h4>
        <p>A montage test should last only 2 montage test rounds.
        If the heroes don't end the montage test by achieving the
        success limit or failure limit, the montage test ends when
        the second montage test round is over. This time limit
        helps to keep a montage test from becoming a slog, and
        prevents heroes from simply using their turns to assist the
        one hero with the best chance of success. This can inspire
        each hero to be a more active participant in the montage
        test. That said, the Director can increase the number of
        rounds a montage test lasts if they wish to create a
        particularly grueling challenge.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="montage-test-difficulty" class="level4">
        <h4>MONTAGE TEST DIFFICULTY</h4>
        <p>The Director determines the success limit and failure
        limit of a montage test. They can share this information or
        keep it secret, depending on what feels the most fun and
        dramatic for the situation and the players.</p>
        <p>In general, the higher the success limit, the harder and
        more complicated it is for the heroes to overcome the
        montage test since a hero can't make the same test twice.
        The <strong>Montage Test Difficulty</strong> table gives a

          <p>For larger or smaller groups, you can make the
          following adjustments to keep montage tests achievable
          but challenging:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For four or fewer heroes, decrease the success
            limit and failure limits by 1 (to a minimum of 2) for
            every hero fewer than five. For example, if your group
            has only three heroes, an easy montage test has a
            success and failure limit of 3.</li>
            <li>For six or more heroes, increase the success and
            failure limits by 1 for every hero more than five.</li>

        <h4>MONTAGE TEST OUTCOMES</h4>
        <p>A montage test can have three different outcomes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the heroes hit the success limit before hitting
          the failure limit or before time runs out for the test,
          they achieve total success.</li>
          <li>If the heroes hit the failure limit or time runs out,
          and if they've achieved at least two more successes than
          failures, they achieve a partial success.</li>
          <li>If the heroes hit the failure limit or time runs out,
          and if they don't have at least two more successes than
          failures, they suffer total failure.</li>
        </ul>
        <section id="total-success" class="level5">
          <h5>TOTAL SUCCESS</h5>
          <p>If the heroes earn a total success, they achieve what
          they set out to do without complication. For instance, if
          the heroes engaged in a montage test to see if they can
          cross a desert to reach a city before a tyrant's army
          arrived there and leveled the place, a total success sees
          them arrive at the city gates with plenty of time to warn
          people of the impending assault. The heroes earn
          <strong>1 Victory</strong> when they achieve total
          success on an easy or moderate montage test, and
          <strong>2 Victories</strong> on a hard montage test.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="partial-success" class="level5">
          <h5>PARTIAL SUCCESS</h5>
          <p>If the heroes earn a partial success, they succeed at
          what they set out to do, but there is a complication or a
          cost involved. For instance, when crossing the desert to
          reach and warn the city of the tyrant's army, a mixed
          success sees the characters arrive at the city gates with
          the enemy forces just behind them. Alternatively, the
          Director might allow the heroes to arrive well before the
          army, but they don't cover their movements well enough.
          The tyrant realizes the city has been warned and decides
          to call in a favor to have a powerful dragon join the
          siege. The heroes earn <strong>1 Victory</strong> when
          they achieve partial success on a hard or moderate
          montage test.</p>

        <section id="total-failure" class="level5">
          <h5>TOTAL FAILURE</h5>
          <p>If the heroes suffer total failure, they don't achieve
          what they set out to do. Just as with standard tests,
          failure on a group test shouldn't bring a story to a
          halt. Total failure should make things more interesting
          and challenging! With a total failure in a montage test
          to cross the desert and warn the city, the characters
          arrive at the city to find it already under siege by the
          tyrant.</p>

        <h4>SAMPLE MONTAGE TEST</h4>
        <p>Four heroes must cross the vast and inhospitable
        Infinite Desert to warn the city of Ahset that the
        tyrannical Empress Vardo is coming to conquer them. If the
        characters arrive in time, they can organize the defenses
        of the city, giving its people a greater chance of
        defeating the tyrant.</p>
        <p>The Director determines that crossing the desert is a
        montage test of hard difficulty. With four heroes involved,
        the success limit is 6 and the failure limit is 2 as the
        montage test begins:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When the test begins, the Director sets the scene.
          They tell the players that the desert has extreme
          temperatures, sudden sandstorms, high dunes to cross,
          deep sand, chasms, and quicksand lakes. The Director
          decides that challenges of dunes, deep sand, and
          quicksand can be tackled multiple times in the test,
          since the Infinite Desert is filled with these
          hazards.</li>
          <li><strong>Urdoncara</strong>, a fury, starts things off
          by asking to make an Intuition test using the Nature
          skill to predict the best times of day to travel and
          rest. She wants the party to avoid the worst of the
          desert's extreme temperatures and any sandstorms or other
          weather phenomena, so that their journey is quickened.
          The Director decides this is an easy test. Urdoncara
          makes the test and gets a result of 12, earning 1 success
          for the montage test.</li>
          <li><strong>Loric</strong>, a tactician, wants to make a
          Reason test using the Climb skill to lead the party over
          dunes and other hazards with minimal effort. The Director
          allows the attempt, but says that knowing what makes one
          dune easier to climb than another is difficult, setting
          the difficulty at medium. Loric gets a 9 on the test and
          fails with a major consequence, which the Director
          decides will cause him to take a bane on his next power
          roll due to the exertion. The montage test currently has
          1 success and 1 failure.</li>
          <li><strong>Karrel</strong>, an elementalist, thinks the
          group might cross the desert faster if they have
          specially modified sandshoes that distribute their weight
          and prevent their feet from sinking into the sand. The
          Director loves the idea and decides that making four
          pairs of the shoes while traveling the desert is a medium
          Reason test. Karrel gets to use their Tailoring skill and
          winds up with a result of 13—a success with a
          consequence. The Director gains an additional 2 VP at the
          start of the next combat encounter as a consequence, but
          the group now has 2 successes and 1 failure on the
          montage test.</li>
          <li><strong>Adrian</strong>, a conduit, offers to scout
          ahead for the group with an Intuition test, using the
          Navigate skill to find the best path forward and avoid
          hazards such as chasms and quicksand. The Director thinks
          this straightforward task of acting as lookout in a vast
          desert is an easy task. Adrian smashes it with a 21, and
          the Director decides to get creative with the reward.
          Adrian's lookout skills grant the next hero to act in the
          montage test an edge on their test. At the end of the
          first montage test round, the heroes have 3 successes and
          1 failure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before the next montage test round, the Director pauses
        the montage test to run a battle with a kingfissure worm,
        who attacks the heroes as they cross over an ancient ruin
        partially buried in the sand. After the heroes defeat the
        kingfissure worm, the test continues:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Urdoncara</strong> wants to make a Might test
          using the Lift skill to carry most of the group's
          equipment as they cross the desert, allowing her allies
          to move more quickly while she keeps up with her superior
          endurance. The Director thinks this arduous task has a
          hard difficulty. Urdoncara gets a 17 on the test thanks
          to the edge from Adrian's earlier success. The montage
          test has 4 successes and 1 failure.</li>
          <li><strong>Loric</strong>, eager to prove himself after
          his last failure, asks to make a Might test using the
          Lead skill, representing tying a rope around his waist to
          drag his weaker friends over the tallest dunes. The
          Director likes the idea, but doesn't think the Lead skill
          applies to the task. He tells Loric that Lift is more
          appropriate, since the tactician is using their physical
          skill to aid their friends and not really doing anything
          interpersonal. Loric agrees, and the Director sets the
          test at medium difficulty. Making the test with a bane
          because of his previous failure, the tactician rolls a
          15, which is a success with a consequence. The montage
          test has 5 successes and 1 failure, but the consequence
          gives the Director another 2 VP at the start of the next
          combat encounter.</li>
          <li>Since the group needs only 1 more success to achieve
          total success, <strong>Karrel</strong> says she'd like to
          assist <strong>Adrian</strong> in whatever task he
          decides to take on. Adrian wants to recall lore about the
          Khem-hor—the inhabitants of the Infinite Desert—to
          remember their time-honored travel techniques using the
          History skill. Karrel has the Culture skill, which she
          can use to assist by providing information about the
          lives and society of the Khem-hor. She makes a Reason
          test to assist and gets a 16, granting Adrian an edge on
          his upcoming test.</li>
          <li><strong>Adrian</strong> attempts to recall lore about
          the Khem-hor, wanting to see if he can remember any of
          their travel techniques from his studies of the history
          of the region. The Director has him make a hard Reason
          test with an edge, thanks to Karrel's input on the
          current state of Khem-hor culture. Adrian gets a 17, and
          the Director decides that the conduit recalls a shortcut
          through a canyon tunnel that leads directly to Ahset,
          avoiding a vast lake of quicksand. The heroes get their
          sixth success in the montage test, achieving total
          success, and earn 2 Victories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The heroes could have attempted other tests during their
        travels, such as an Agility test using the Stealth skill to
        lead the group through dangerous shortcuts in the desert
        without being seen or waylaid by predators, a Reason test
        using the Nature skill to find enough food and water to
        keep the group hydrated and fed, or a Presence test using
        the Music skill to inspire allies to travel faster with
        song.</p>

    <h2>ADVENTURING</h2>
    <p>This section collects a number of the rules for adventuring
    that make up the heart of the game. These rules will be
    organized differently as the game is developed.</p>
    <section id="resistance-rolls" class="level3">
      <h3>RESISTANCE ROLLS</h3>
      <p>Resistance rolls are special power rolls made to avoid
      harmful effects from traps, hazards, and other creatures'
      attacks and abilities. You don't decide when it's time to
      make a resistance roll. Instead, you make one in response to
      a dangerous situation when the rules or the Director call for
      it. The higher the result of the resistance roll, the less
      harm the effect does to your character.</p>
      <p>For example, a hero who activates a fire trap might need
      to make the following resistance roll:</p>
      <p><strong>Resistance + Agility</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>11 or lower: 9 fire damage</li>
        <li>12–16: 6 fire damage</li>
        <li>17+: 2 fire damage</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="adjacent" class="level3">
      <h3>ADJACENT</h3>
      <p>Many abilities and other options refer to creatures,
      objects, or spaces that are adjacent to a specified creature.
      Something is adjacent to a creature if it is within 1 square
      of that creature.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="falling" class="level3">
      <h3>FALLING</h3>
      <p>When you fall 2 or more squares, you take 2 damage for
      each square you fall, then you land prone. When you fall, you
      reduce the effective height of the fall by a number of
      squares equal to your Agility score. Falling into liquid that
      is at least 1 square deep reduces the effective height of a
      fall by 4 squares.</p>
      <p>Falling is not forced movement, but being force moved
      downward is considered falling (see Forced Movement in
      Combat). Movement from falling doesn't provoke opportunity
      attacks (see Opportunity Attacks).</p>
      <section id="falling-onto-another-creature" class="level4">
        <h4>FALLING ONTO ANOTHER CREATURE</h4>
        <p>If you land on another creature when you fall, that
        creature takes the same damage you do from the fall. You
        then land prone in the nearest unoccupied space of your
        choice. If your size is greater than the creature's Might
        score, the creature also falls prone.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="falling-far" class="level4">
        <h4>FALLING FAR</h4>
        <p>When you first fall from a great height, you fall 100
        squares in the first round. At the end of each subsequent
        round that you remain falling, you fall another 100
        squares.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="hide-and-sneak" class="level3">
      <h3>HIDE AND SNEAK</h3>
      <p>Hiding and sneaking are important tools for heroes and
      their foes. You might want to avoid another creatures' notice
      to eavesdrop on conversations, steal items, set up an ambush,
      or avoid a combat encounter.</p>
      <section id="hiding" class="level4">
        <h4>HIDING</h4>
        <p>When you wish to hide from a creature, you must have
        cover or concealment (see Combat) from your foe, and that
        foe can't observe you attempting to hide. If you duck
        behind a barrel to hide from a foe, your attempt to hide
        has a chance of succeeding only if your foe doesn't notice
        you doing so. If you are being chased by a hungry dragon,
        you can hide only if you first move into a place where the
        dragon can't observe you, such as turning a sharp corner
        into a tunnel full of giant stalagmites before the dragon
        does. You then make your hide attempt.</p>
        <p>Most often, you use the Hide maneuver to hide during
        combat (see Maneuvers). If you do so while you have cover
        or concealment from a creature who isn't observing you, you
        are automatically hidden from them unless the Director
        deems otherwise. If you hide outside of combat, the
        Director might ask you to make a test using the Hide
        skill.</p>
        <p>If you are hidden from another creature, you gain an
        edge on attacks made against them, and the creature can't
        target you with attacks. You are no longer hidden from a
        creature if you don't have cover or concealment from them.
        If you use an ability, interact with an enemy creature,
        move without sneaking, or otherwise make noise or reveal
        yourself while hidden, you are no longer hidden once the
        thing you're doing resolves. For instance, if you are
        hidden and then make an attack, you resolve the attack
        first, then are no longer hidden.</p>
        <section id="searching-for-hidden-creatures" class=
        "level5">
          <h5>SEARCHING FOR HIDDEN CREATURES</h5>
          <p>You can search for creatures who are hidden from you
          as long as those creatures are within 10 squares of you
          and you have line of effect to them. To do so, you make
          an Intuition test as a maneuver and assess the
          result:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>11 or lower</strong>: You find any hidden
            creatures with an Agility of 0 or lower and who don't
            have the Hide skill.</li>
            <li><strong>12–16</strong>: You find any hidden
            creatures who don't have the Hide skill.</li>
            <li><strong>17 or more</strong>: You find all hidden
            creatures.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As part of this maneuver, you can point out any
          creatures you find to allies within 10 squares of you,
          making those creatures no longer hidden from those
          allies.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section id="sneak" class="level4">
        <h4>SNEAK</h4>
        <p>While you are hidden from another creature and you want
        to move, you can attempt to sneak in order to remain
        hidden. While sneaking, your speed is halved, and you must
        end your move with cover or concealment from the creatures
        you are hidden from. If you do so, you can make an Agility
        test with a difficulty set by the Director, remaining
        hidden if you succeed. This test can use another
        characteristic at the Director's discretion.</p>

      <h3>LANGUAGES</h3>
      <p>When you create your hero, you'll be able to select the
      languages they know. The following details the languages of
      Orden, the baseline world of the game, but the Director can
      use these languages in their own campaign world or swap this
      list with their own languages.</p>
      <p>If your hero knows a language, they can speak, read,
      write, and understand it.</p>
      <p><em>(Playtest note: The full list of languages for the
      game isn't included here. More is coming.)</em></p>
      <section id="caelian-empire" class="level4">
        <h4>CAELIAN EMPIRE</h4>
        <p>The Caelian Empire dominated five of the seven regions
        of Orden three thousand years ago. During the height of
        this most recent human empire, all humans (including folks
        from Vanigar in the far north, but not folks from the
        islands of Ix) learned to speak the Caelian tongue. For
        many, especially the noble classes and the well-to-do,
        Caelian effectively replaced their native language.</p>
        <p>Some thirteen hundred years after the fall of the
        Caelian Empire, the languages of the different regions of
        the empire are enjoying a resurgence. Still, the Caelian
        tongue is spoken by most humans in most regions to one
        extent or another.</p>
        <p>Most people in Orden can speak and understand some
        Caelian, simply because the empire was so powerful and so
        widespread. Anyone trading with the empire or living near
        its borders or under its influence eventually learned to
        speak Caelian, including dwarves, elves, orcs, lizardfolk,
        and goblins. If you speak more than one language in Orden,
        your second language is almost certainly Caelian. As a
        result, that language of empire is now colloquially
        referred to as “the common tongue”—the language that most
        folk of Orden have in common.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="extant-spoken-languages" class="level4">
        <h4>EXTANT SPOKEN LANGUAGES</h4>
        <p>Folks have been speaking and writing in Orden for at
        least thirty thousand years, but most of those languages
        are now dead. Many have been forgotten. Others were spoken
        by peoples who never developed writing, preventing those
        languages from being preserved. And many languages that
        were preserved in writing left no related descendants, so
        that no one knows what sounds that writing represented.</p>
        <p>The languages on the Vasloria Languages by Ancestry
        table are the most common languages in that region,
        actively spoken by significant populations. Most languages
        are associated with a specific ancestry and its culture,
        but being a member of an ancestry doesn't automatically
        make you part of the associated culture the language is
        tied to. For example, if your orc hero was raised in a
        culture of elves, you probably speak one of the elven
        languages and might never have learned Kalliak.</p>
        <p>Most languages have colloquial or casual names. For
        instance, many people in Orden call Kalliak “Orcish” and
        Hyrallic “Elvish,” but any sage knows there are many orcish
        and elven languages, just as there are multiple human
        languages.</p>

          <h5>LANGUAGE USAGE</h5>
          <p><strong>Hyrallic</strong> is the primary language of
          the high elves in Orden. Although young for an elven
          language, Hyrallic is older than almost all other modern
          cultural languages, save those of the dwarves. As a
          result, while anyone who lives near or trades with a
          human culture probably speaks at least a little Caelian,
          most nobles across all ancestries make sure their
          children or offspring speak Hyrallic. Caelian is new from
          many cultures' point of view, while Hyrallic as a
          language for diplomacy is considered cultured and
          traditional.</p>
          <p><strong>Yllyric</strong> is the cultural language of
          wode elves, and also the common language among those who
          defend and protect the natural forests of Orden.</p>
          <p>Within any document concerning the workings of
          machines, masonry, or geology, you are likely to find a
          healthy supply of jargon using <strong>Zaliac</strong>,
          the most popular dwarven language. Even when such texts
          aren't fully written in Zaliac, they use a lot of dwarven
          language when describing esoteric, complex ideas.</p>
          <p>Just as Zaliac is used in engineering, contract law
          isn't written purely in <strong>Anjal</strong>, the
          dominant language of the Seven Cities of Hell. But, a lot
          of the legal jargon in any contract, as well as some of
          the language of trial courts, features many Anjal words.
          People are sticklers for detail in the Seven Cities,
          making their language popular among lawyers.</p>
          <p>In the same way that intelligent creatures in Orden
          who live near or trade with other cultures use
          <strong>Caelian</strong> as a common language, the
          denizens of the World Below, the Dark Under All, often
          speak <strong>Variac</strong>, the language of the
          voiceless talkers.</p>

        <h4>DEAD LANGUAGES</h4>
        <p>For an adventuring hero with an ambition to create great
        works or unlock deep lore, it can be useful to be able to
        read ancient writing. Much deep lore is attested only in
        ancient tomes and scrolls written in languages that no
        modern culture uses.</p>
        <p>Most of these ancient writings were written by people
        who expected other people to read it. The lore might have
        been kept secret by not sharing it with anyone outside the
        college or cult whose members originally wrote it, but the
        actual writing was not intended to be difficult to read or
        understand. It wasn't written in code—just in a language
        that people stopped speaking long ago.</p>
        <p>Sages can reconstruct many of these languages by
        learning which modern languages descended from them, then
        comparing them to related languages from the same time
        period that might have survived. Translating such ancient
        languages has been extremely useful for the purposes of
        crafting and research.</p>

      <h3>RENOWN</h3>
      <p>As you accomplish heroic deeds, your fame allows you to
      influence NPCs and attract followers. Your infamy among
      enemies also grows, and their hatred and fear of you can
      cause foes to lash out during negotiations (see Negotiation).
      Every hero has a Renown score that represents how they can
      use their reputation to influence others. The higher the
      score, the greater your impact with those who know of your
      legend.</p>
      <p>At the start of character creation, your Renown is 0. Some
      careers can increase your initial Renown score (see
      Careers).</p>
      <section id="increasing-renown" class="level4">
        <h4>INCREASING RENOWN</h4>
        <p>Renown typically increases at the end of an adventure,
        often after the acknowledgment of a powerful NPC that you
        helped save them, their family, their home, or their
        organization. That NPC and anyone else who witnessed your
        heroics can tell the tale, and from there, your legend
        grows.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>In general, a hero gains 1 Renown each time they
            complete an adventure. If you want the characters to be
            less famous than in a standard heroic tale, you can
            adjust this to give out Renown only after every other
            adventure or only when the heroes level up.
            Alternatively, you can award more Renown after each
            adventure if you want the heroes to become power
            players in the world more quickly.</p>

        <h4>SPECIFIC USES FOR RENOWN</h4>
        <p>The Director can use Renown as a tool that determines
        how much access heroes have to exclusive places in the
        campaign's world, or how much power they wield in
        organizations of which they are members. The rules for
        using Renown in such ways is in the For the Director

      <h3>SUPERNATURAL AND MUNDANE</h3>
      <p>The word <strong>supernatural</strong> is used to describe
      abilities, creatures, and objects that are magical or psionic
      in nature.</p>
      <p>The word <strong>mundane</strong> is used to describe

      <p>Out of combat, you can hold your breath for a number of

    <section id="adventuring-gear" class="level3">
      <h3>ADVENTURING GEAR</h3>
      <p>This isn't a game about tracking gear, so you don't need
      to list every piece of equipment you own on your character
      sheet. The game assumes that heroes generally have enough to
      eat and drink, so the rules don't expect you to track food
      and water either.</p>
      <p>If your character has a skill that implicitly requires
      gear, such as lockpicks for the Pick Lock skill or basic
      alchemy supplies for use with the Alchemy skill, then you
      have that gear. Likewise, your character is assumed to have
      standard useful adventuring gear, including a torch, a rope,
      and a backpack at minimum.</p>
      <p>At the Director's discretion, you might lose certain gear
      in the course of an adventure, or your gear could break. If
      this happens, you might not be able to perform certain tasks
      as effectively without that gear.</p>
      <section id="torches" class="level4">
        <h4>TORCHES</h4>
        <p>A torch sheds light for 10 squares in every direction,
        and you can light a torch as a free maneuver. Just as you
        don't need to track every ration or arrow you use, you
        don't need to track how long a torch lasts.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="rope" class="level4">
        <h4>ROPE</h4>
        <p>A rope is 10 squares long. A creature able to use an
        anchored rope to climb can do so without needing to make a
        test unless the Director deems otherwise.</p>

    <section id="wealth" class="level3">
      <h3>WEALTH</h3>
      <p>This game also isn't about accumulating and counting every
      piece of copper you acquire. Instead of tracking a bank
      account, the amount of stuff your hero can purchase is based
      on their level. As you accomplish more deeds, you acquire
      more treasure and rewards from grateful NPCs that allow you
      to be an even more effective hero.</p>
      <p>The Hero Wealth table shows the types of items, gear,
      services, property, and more that you can purchase at various
      levels in the game. The table shows both the purchases that
      heroes can acquire individually and that a party can acquire
      when the characters pool their resources together as a
      group.</p>
      <p>This isn't an exhaustive list, but you and the Director
      can use the table to judge what your character can and can't
      purchase. For instance, the price of an ox isn't on this
      list, but you can reasonably assume that if you can buy a
      horse, you can probably afford an ox as well. (Don't @ us,
      farm nerds.) And if you can't afford something you want, fear
      not! You might still be able to acquire a specific good or
      service through negotiation, or by trading your heroic
      services instead of spending cash. Treasures such as magic
      swords and psionic crowns are rare and typically can't be
      purchased. Instead, they're found on adventures, traded for
      other treasures, given as rewards by NPCs, or crafted by the
      characters.</p>

    <h2>ABILITIES</h2>
    <p>Your class, kit, ancestry, titles, and other heroic options
    give you access to abilities that make your hero stand out.
    Abilities are special actions, maneuvers, and more that allow
    you to affect creatures, objects, and the environment.
    Abilities are presented in a format that breaks out specific
    entries for keywords, time, distance, target, and effect. If an
    ability is an attack, it also includes a damage entry.</p>
    <section id="name-and-story-text" class="level3">
      <h3>NAME AND STORY TEXT</h3>
      <p>Each ability has an evocative name that sets up what it
      does in the game, followed by a line or two of flavor text
      that provides a sense of how the use of the ability might
      appear if described in an action scene in a story.</p>
      <p>The name and story text for abilities sometimes make
      reference to specific ways in which the ability is
      used—particularly combat abilities whose names imply specific
      types of weapons or tactics. However, that narrative flavor
      has no effect on how an ability can be used. For example, the
      fury's <em>Impaling Strike</em> ability allows you to grab a
      target, setting up the idea of harpooning your monstrous foe
      with a sword, then wrenching them in close before pulling
      your weapon free. But you can use that ability with an axe, a
      mace, a hammer, or any other weapon.</p>

      </section>
      <section id="magic" class="level4">
        <h4>MAGIC</h4>
        <p>Magic-keyword abilities are used by creatures who can
        cast spells, have innate magical features, or wield magic
        items. These abilities do magical things such as create
        rays of fire, open swirling portals, or summon
        creatures.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="melee" class="level4">

        <p>Abilities with the Melee keyword can be used only over
        very short distances, typically within a creature's reach,

        your body, a weapon, or an implement.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="psionic" class="level4">
        <h4>PSIONIC</h4>
        <p>Psionic-keyword abilities are used by creatures who can
        manifest psionic powers, have innate psionic features, or
        wield psionic items. These abilities might create blasts of
        psychic energy, move objects with telekinesis, or slow down

        Resistance-keyword abilities right now.)</p>
      </section>
      <section id="weapon" class="level4">
        <h4>WEAPON</h4>
        <p>The Weapon keyword is used in attacks that are made with
        blades, bows, and other such items. Weapon abilities also
        include attacks creatures make with their own bodies, such
        as punches, kicks, bites, tail slaps, and more. Your kit
        determines the types of weapons you wield and use with
        weapon abilities (see Kits).</p>
      </section>
      <section id="its-not-all-attacks" class="level4">
        <h4>IT'S NOT ALL ATTACKS!</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The Attack keyword and phrases like “makes an attack”
          are reserved for abilities that have a creature
          specifically targeting other creatures or objects (not an
          area) and dealing harm to them by making a power roll.
          Other abilities that target areas of effect, or that
          require the target to make a resistance roll instead of
          having the creature using the ability make the roll, are
          not attacks. They instead use the Area and Resistance
          keywords, respectively. That means if a feature
          distinctly interacts with an attack (for instance, the
          conduit's Holy Infusion triggered action), that feature
          has no effect on abilities with the Area or Resistance
          keyword.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="type" class="level3">
      <h3>TYPE</h3>
      <p>Each ability has a “Type” entry that describes how long it
      takes to execute the ability. For instance, if you use an
      ability that has “Action” as its type entry, you must use
      your action to activate the ability. Most abilities require
      you to use an action, a maneuver, a triggered action, a free
      maneuver, or a free triggered action (see Combat for more
      information).</p>
      <p>If an ability takes 1 minute or longer to use, you can't
      use it in combat.</p>
      <section id="trigger" class="level4">
        <h4>TRIGGER</h4>
        <p>If an ability requires a triggered action or a free
        triggered action to use, a “Trigger” entry is part of the
        ability. For example, the trigger for the tactician's Parry
        ability is: “A creature makes a Weapon attack against the
        target.”</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="distance" class="level3">
      <h3>DISTANCE</h3>
      <p>An ability's “Distance” entry indicates how close you need
      to be to a creature or object to affect that target with the
      ability.</p>
      <section id="melee-1" class="level4">
        <h4>MELEE</h4>
        <p>Abilities with a distance of “Reach X” require you to
        touch a creature with your body, a weapon, or an implement.
        X is the distance in squares at which you can physically
        make contact with another creature or object targeted by
        the ability. For instance, a distance of “Reach 2” can be
        used to target creatures or objects within 2 squares of
        you.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="ranged-1" class="level4">
        <h4>RANGED</h4>
        <p>Abilities with a distance noted as “Ranged” can be used
        to target creatures who are more than a touch away. Ranged
        distances are presented as “Ranged X,” with X being the
        number of squares away a creature or object can be while
        still allowing you to target them with the ability. For
        instance, a distance of “Ranged 5” can be used to target
        creatures or objects within 5 squares of you.</p>
        <p>If you make a ranged attack while an enemy is adjacent
        to you, you have a bane on the attack's power roll.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="melee-or-ranged" class="level4">
        <h4>MELEE OR RANGED</h4>
        <p>Some abilities have a melee distance and a ranged
        distance. When you use such an ability, you choose whether
        to use it as a melee or a ranged ability. The ability never
        has both the Melee and Ranged keywords at the same time.
        For example, if you have the Cloak and Dagger kit, which
        has a weapon damage bonus to melee and ranged abilities,
        only one bonus at a time applies to an ability with the
        Melee or Ranged keywords.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="area-abilities" class="level4">
        <h4>AREA ABILITIES</h4>
        <p>Area abilities cover an area, creating an effect within
        that area that lets you target multiple creatures or
        objects at once. When an ability allows you to create an
        area of effect, you are sometimes given a distance, noted
        as “within X,” that describes how many squares away from
        you the area can be. If an area ability doesn't originate
        from you, then at least 1 square of the area of effect must
        be within that distance and your line of effect. This
        square is referred to as the origin square of the area of
        effect. The area of effect can spread from the origin
        square however you choose, as long as the area of effect
        conforms to the shape and arrangement rules of that
        particular area.</p>
        <p>Unless otherwise noted, area abilities don't pass
        through solid barriers such as walls or ceilings or spread
        around corners. These obstructions stop areas from
        spreading. As long as you have line of effect and distance
        to the origin square, you can place an area ability to
        include one or more squares where you don't have line of
        effect (see Line of Effect below).</p>
        <p>An area ability might use any of the following areas of
        effect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Aura</strong>: When an ability creates an
          aura, it is expressed as “X aura.” Aura areas always
          originate from you and move with you for the duration of
          the ability that created them. A creature must be within
          X squares of you to be targeted by an aura ability.</li>
          <li><strong>Burst</strong>: When an ability creates a
          burst area, it is expressed as “X burst.” Burst areas
          always originate from you. A creature must be within X
          squares of you to be targeted with a burst ability.</li>
          <li><strong>Cube</strong>: When an ability affects a
          cubic area, it is expressed as “X cube.” X is the length
          of all the area's sides.</li>
          <li><strong>Line</strong>: When an ability affects a
          linear area, it is expressed as “A × B line.” This means
          that A equals the line's length in squares, while B
          equals the line's width and height in squares.</li>
          <li><strong>Wall</strong>: When an ability creates a
          wall, it is expressed as “X wall,” where X equals how
          many squares are used to make the wall. When you place a
          wall, you can build it one square at a time, but each
          square must share at least one side (not just a corner)
          with another square of the wall. You can stack squares on
          top of each other to make the wall higher. Unless
          otherwise stated, a wall can't be placed in occupied
          squares, and a wall blocks line of effect.</li>
          <li><strong>Special</strong>: Some abilities create a
          unique area of effect. The distance entry of such
          abilities specifies how the area is created.</li>

      <section id="self" class="level4">
        <h4>SELF</h4>

      <section id="creature" class="level4">
        <h4>CREATURE</h4>
        <p>If an ability targets one or more creatures, you can
        have it target any creature within the ability's distance.
        You aren't an eligible creature target for your own
        abilities unless those abilities also have “self” as a
        target (see below).</p>

        otherwise noted, objects have poison and psychic immunity.
        When an ability can target creatures and objects, the

      <h3>ABILITY POWER ROLL</h3>
      <p>If an ability requires a power roll, it has a “Power Roll”
      entry that tells you which characteristic to add to the 2d10
      roll you make when you activate the ability. Unlike power
      rolls made as tests, ability power rolls always do something
      useful when you make them. You're just rolling to see the
      impact of the ability, including damage and any effects based
      on the tier result of the power roll.</p>
      <p>For instance, the fury's Brutal Slam ability is a melee
      attack that targets a creature within reach, and which has
      the following effects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tier 1 (11 or lower):</strong> The attack deals
        3 damage and pushes the target back 1 square.</li>
        <li><strong>Tier 2 (12–16):</strong> The attack deals 8
        damage and pushes the target back 2 squares.</li>
        <li><strong>Tier 3 (17 or more):</strong> The attack deals
        12 damage and pushes the target back 4 squares.</li>
      </ul>
      <section id="abilities-with-damage-and-effects" class=

        <h4>ABILITIES WITH DAMAGE AND EFFECTS</h4>
        <p>Both attacks and area abilities deal damage and often
        have an additional effect on their target. The amount of
        damage and the strength of the effect are determined by the
        power roll.</p>
        <p>To keep things quick and easy to read at the table,
        damage and effects are separated in a power roll entry with
        a semicolon, with effects abbreviated whenever possible. An
        effect determined by the power roll result always applies
        to the target unless otherwise specified. For instance, the
        Brutal Slam ability described above has the following power
        roll setup:</p>
        <p><strong>Power Roll + Might:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>11 or lower:</strong> 3 damage; push 1</li>
          <li><strong>12–16:</strong> 8 damage; push 2</li>
          <li><strong>17+:</strong> 12 damage; push 4</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unless otherwise indicated, any effects that are
        determined by a power roll result occur after the power
        roll's damage has been dealt to all targets.</p>
        <section id="critical-hit" class="level5">
          <h5>CRITICAL HIT</h5>
          <p>When you make a power roll as part of an attack or
          action and the total of the roll is 19 or 20 before
          adding your characteristic (a natural 19 or natural 20),
          you score a critical hit. This allows you to immediately
          take an additional action after resolving the power roll,
          whether or not it's your turn and even if you are dazed
          (see Conditions).</p>

          <p>Certain ability effects allow you to move and affect
          other creatures or objects during that move, such as the
          shadow's Blade Dance ability. For such abilities, the
          move begins in the space you first leave when you move,

      <section id="roll-against-multiple-creatures" class="level4">
        <h4>ROLL AGAINST MULTIPLE CREATURES</h4>
        <p>When an ability targets multiple creatures, you make one
        power roll and apply the result to all the creatures you
        target. If you have edges or banes against some but not all
        of your targets, you might apply a different tier of result
        to individual targets.</p>
        <p>For example, if you target three creatures with an
        attack ability and your result is 11, each of the targets
        should be affected by the tier 1 result of the ability.
        However, if you gain an edge on attacks against one of the
        targets to add 2 to the power roll, your result against
        that target is 13 and that target is affected by the tier 2
        result of the ability.</p>

    <section id="resistance-rolls-1" class="level3">
      <h3>RESISTANCE ROLLS</h3>
      <p>Some abilities that are used by the heroes' foes have the
      target of the ability make a resistance roll instead of the
      creature using the ability making a power roll. These
      abilities have the Resistance keyword, indicating that the
      target rolls to see how well they can resist the ability. For
      instance, the goblin cursespitter's Eye of Surlach ability
      forces a target to make an Intuition resistance roll:</p>
      <p><strong>Target Resists + Intuition:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>11 or lower: 6 corruption damage; weakened (INU
        ends)</li>
        <li>12–16: 5 corruption damage; weakened (EoT)</li>
        <li>17+: 2 corruption damage</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because a resistance roll measures how well a target
      shakes off an ability's damage and effects, the higher the
      tier result of the roll, the weaker the ability's damage and
      effects.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="effect" class="level3">
      <h3>EFFECT</h3>
      <p>Many abilities that require power rolls also have effect
      entries describing additional effects or rules for how the
      ability is used. If an ability doesn't require a power roll,
      it has an effect entry that describes how it works.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="spend-resource" class="level3">
      <h3>SPEND RESOURCE</h3>
      <p>Some abilities have a “Spend X [Heroic Resource]” entry.
      These are similar to effect entries, except they cost Heroic
      Resources to use. You must spend X of your Heroic Resource to
      activate the effect. If the entry reads “Spend [Heroic
      Resource]” with no number, then you can spend as much of your
      Heroic Resource as you like to increase the effect's impact,
      as described in the entry's details.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="stacking-unique-effects" class="level3">
      <h3>STACKING UNIQUE EFFECTS</h3>
      <p>The unique effects of different abilities are combined if
      their durations and targets overlap. However, the effects of
      the same ability used multiple times don't add together.
      Instead, the most impactful result—such as the highest
      bonus—from each use of the ability applies. The most recent
      ability applies for determining duration.</p>
      <p>Different effects that impose the same condition (see
      Conditions) don't stack to impose the condition twice. For
      example, if a hero is targeted by numerous creatures whose
      abilities can halve a target's recovery value, the hero's
      recovery value is only halved once.</p>

        follows:</p>
        <p><strong>Power Roll + [Specified

        <ul>

      <h3>LINE OF EFFECT</h3>
      <p>To target a creature or object with an ability, including
      attacking the creature or object, you must have line of
      effect to that creature or object. If a solid object, such as
      a wall or pillar, completely blocks the creature from you,
      then you don't have line of effect to them. If you're not
      sure if you have line of effect to a creature, imagine
      drawing a straight line from any corner of the space you
      occupy on the map to any corner of a space the creature
      occupies. If you can do this with at least one corner
      connecting to another with no obstruction in between, you
      have line of effect to the creature.</p>
      <p>At the Director's discretion, flimsy or fragile
      obstructions such as a glass window or linen curtains don't
      block line of effect and might be automatically broken or
      torn by attacks made through them.</p>
      <p>If you want to create an area of effect in a specific
      area, you must have line of effect to at least one of the
      squares in that area. See Area Abilities.</p>

          square is 5 feet on all sides. The Director can change

      </section>
      <section id="size-and-space" class="level4">
        <h4>SIZE AND SPACE</h4>
        <p>A creature's size indicates how many squares they occupy
        during combat, which defines the creature's space. If a
        creature's size is 1, they occupy a space of 1 square. If a
        creature is larger than 1 square, their size equals the
        number of squares they take up in length, width, and
        height. For example, a horse has a size of 2, which means
        that during combat, they occupy a space that is 2 squares
        long, 2 squares wide, and 2 squares high. You could also
        think of that space as a cube that is 2 squares on all
        sides.</p>
        <p>If a creature is a size 1, their size value includes the
        letter T, S, M, or L, abbreviations of tiny, small, medium,
        and large respectively. Since the minimal amount of space a
        creature can take up during combat is 1, this letter
        indicates the difference between tiny pixies, small
        polders, medium humans, and large hakaan, each of which
        occupy of a space 1 square in combat. These sizes in order
        from smallest to largest are 1T, 1S, 1M, and 1L.</p>
        <p>Objects can also have a size rating. If an object has an
        O (an abbreviation for oblong) next to its size, it
        indicates that the object's size isn't the number of
        squares the object occupies, but rather it's relative mass
        and weight to a creature of equivalent size. If an ability
        or feature allows you to interact with objects of a certain
        size that rule includes all objects of that size, oblong or
        otherwise.</p>
        <p>The Creature and Object Sizes table shows examples sizes
        of creatures and objects up to size 5, but there is no
        limit to what a creature or object's size could be.</p>

        oppose the heroes are on the same side, even if those
        creatures also oppose each other. For example, if the
        heroes are battling a group of bandits when a kingfissure
        worm suddenly bursts into the fray to devour player
        characters and brigands alike, the worm is still on the
        side of the bandits for the purpose of the game's combat
        rules.</p>

            Director has enough to worry about. As well, any
            missteps, mistakes, or triumphs the ally makes will be
            thanks to the decisions of the players and not the
            Director, which can make the outcome of the battle more
            satisfying for the players.</p>

      <h3>COMBAT ROUND</h3>
      <p>Combat takes place over a series of rounds. During a
      round, each creature in the battle takes a turn. Once every
      creature has taken a turn, a new round begins.</p>
      <section id="determine-surprise" class="level4">
        <h4>DETERMINE SURPRISE</h4>
        <p>When battle begins, the Director determines which
        creatures, if any, are caught off guard. Any creature who
        isn't ready for combat at the start of an encounter is
        surprised until the end of the first round of combat. A
        surprised creature can't take triggered or free triggered
        actions, attacks and damaging area powers rolled against
        them gain an edge, and they have a bane on resistance
        rolls.</p>
        <p>For example, if the heroes sneak up unnoticed on a camp
        of marauders and attack, each marauder is surprised.
        Likewise, if the heroes fail to notice that all the cloaked
        figures in a tavern are actually brain-devouring zombies,
        then the heroes are surprised. If one of the heroes notices
        the disguised undead before the zombies attack but has no
        opportunity to warn their allies, that hero isn't surprised
        but the rest of the characters are.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="determine-who-goes-first" class="level4">
        <h4>DETERMINE WHO GOES FIRST</h4>
        <p>Sometimes figuring out who gets to take the first turn
        in combat is automatic. If all the creatures on one side
        are surprised, then a creature on the other side gets to go
        first. But if both sides have creatures who aren't
        surprised, the Director or a player they choose rolls 1d10.
        On a result of 6 or greater, the heroes' side acts first.
        Otherwise, the other side acts first.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="creatures-take-turns" class="level4">
        <h4>CREATURES TAKE TURNS</h4>
        <p>Whichever side goes first chooses a creature (or
        sometimes a group of creatures on the Director's side) to
        act at the start of combat. Whenever the rules talk about a
        creature acting in combat, that creature gets to take their
        turn. When that turn is over, the other side chooses a
        creature to act. Play continues back and forth this way as
        each creature takes their turn.</p>
        <p>Unless an ability or special rule allows them to do so,
        any creature who has taken a turn during a round can't act
        again until a new round begins. To help track which
        creatures have already acted in the current round, each
        creature can have a coin, token, or card they flip over on
        the table, or some kind of flag they set on their virtual
        tabletop token, once they've taken a turn. That way, all
        the players know who has already acted and who hasn't.</p>
        <p>In many encounters, a point comes when one side has
        creatures who haven't acted yet but all the creatures on
        the other side have. The creatures who have yet to act get
        to take their turns in any order they choose, without turns
        in between from the other side. For example, consider four
        heroes taking on six enemies. When all four heroes have
        taken their turns and four of the enemies have taken
        theirs, the two enemies who are left take their turns one
        after the other to end the round.</p>
        <p>Once all creatures on both sides of a battle have acted,
        the round ends and a new one begins. The side whose members
        acted first during the starting round of combat acts first
        in all subsequent rounds.</p>
        <section id="determining-who-acts-next" class="level5">
          <h5>DETERMINING WHO ACTS NEXT</h5>
          <p>When it comes to the heroes' side, the choice of who
          should act next is intended to give players the
          opportunity to comment, strategize, and plan. Some
          tables, in some encounters, might find that the choice of
          who should act next isn't obvious, leading to debate.
          That's fine. Deliberating about what the group should do
          next is classic roleplaying.</p>
          <p>In general, though, most groups find that it's usually
          only one or two players in a given round who think it
          best if they act next. And as soon as those players
          explain why they want to act next and what they plan on
          doing, the issue is quickly resolved.</p>

          <p>If the players do end up arguing in circles about what
          to do next, the Director can place a timer on the
          discussion. Usually, giving the players a warning and 30
          seconds to decide who goes next does the trick. If they
          can't choose by the end of that time, the Director
          chooses a hero to act.</p>

          <h5>ALTERNATIVE INITIATIVE</h5>
          <blockquote>
            <p>If planning everyone's turn order isn't fun for your
            group, you can leave it to the dice instead. At the
            start of combat, have each hero, enemy, and group of
            enemies make an Agility test, then record the results.
            When it's time for someone on the heroes' side to act,
            the hero with the highest result goes first. On the
            next hero turn, the hero with the second-highest result
            takes their turn, and so on. The Director-controlled
            creatures act the same way. Creatures on the same side
            should reroll tied Agility tests to determine who among
            the tied creatures acts before the others.</p>
            <p>At the Director's discretion, a hero can swap their
            turn in the initiative order with another willing hero
            at the start of a new round of combat. This allows
            certain abilities that interact with the core
            initiative system, such as the shadow's
            <strong>Hesitation is Weakness</strong> ability, to
            better work with this alternative system.</p>

        <h4>TAKING A TURN</h4>
        <p>Each creature in combat—whether hero, adversary, or
        something in between—gets to take a move action, a
        maneuver, and an action on their turn. Each combatant can
        perform their maneuver and action in any order, and can
        break up the movement granted by their move action before,
        after, or between their maneuver and action however they
        like. You can also turn your action into a move action or a
        maneuver, so that your turn can alternatively consist of
        two move actions and a maneuver; or two maneuvers and a
        move action.</p>
        <p>The Movement section breaks down how your move action
        works, while the Maneuvers and Actions sections break down
        the baseline maneuvers and actions your character can
        undertake. For any activities not specifically covered in
        those rules, such as cutting down a chandelier to drop on
        enemies, the Director decides whether such an activity is a
        maneuver or an action.</p>
        <section id="triggered-actions-and-free-triggered-actions"
        class="level5">
          <h5>TRIGGERED ACTIONS AND FREE TRIGGERED ACTIONS</h5>
          <p>Your hero might have one or more unique triggered
          actions, each of which has a specified trigger that
          allows the action to be used. You can use one triggered
          action per round, either on your turn or another
          creature's turn, but only when the action's trigger
          occurs. For instance, a fury hero can use the
          <strong>Relentless Toss</strong> triggered action to
          force move a target, but only after an enemy has first
          tried to force move the fury or one of their allies.</p>
          <p>A free triggered action follows the same rules as a
          triggered action, but it doesn't count against your limit
          of one triggered action per round. For instance, a shadow
          hero can use their <strong>Hesitation is
          Weakness</strong> ability to take their turn in response
          to the trigger of another hero ending their turn. But
          because that ability is a free triggered action, the
          shadow can still use their <strong>In All This
          Confusion</strong> triggered action if attacked by an
          enemy.</p>
          <p>If multiple triggered actions occur in response to the
          same trigger, any heroes and other player-controlled
          creatures taking a triggered action or a free triggered
          action decide among themselves which of those triggered
          actions are resolved first. Then the Director decides the
          same for creatures they control.</p>
          <p>Any effect that prevents you from making triggered
          actions also prevents you from making free triggered
          actions.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="free-maneuvers" class="level5">
          <h5>FREE MANEUVERS</h5>
          <p>Boring stuff like opening an unlocked door, picking up
          an arrow from the ground, giving an object to an adjacent
          ally, or drawing a weapon doesn't require a maneuver or
          an action. Rather, you can undertake such straightforward
          activities as free maneuvers on your turn. A free
          maneuver follows the same rules as a regular maneuver,
          but you can typically take as many free maneuvers as you
          like.</p>
          <p>At the Director's discretion, circumstances could make
          something that is typically boring more impactful and
          exciting. For instance, if you need to pick a magic arrow
          up off the ground during a violent earthquake, what would
          otherwise be a free maneuver could require a maneuver or
          an action to accomplish.</p>
          <p>Likewise, the nature of an activity might make it too
          complicated for a free maneuver. For example, picking up
          the body of an unconscious talent ally to carry them to
          safety can probably be done as a free maneuver. But if
          your Might is lacking and you need to pick up a tactician
          ally decked out in the Shining Armor kit, the Director
          might determine that you need to use a regular maneuver
          to hoist their armored form over your shoulders.</p>
          <p>Any effect that prevents you from making maneuvers
          also prevents you from making free maneuvers.</p>

        <section id="no-action-activities" class="level5">
          <h5>NO-ACTION ACTIVITIES</h5>
          <p>Free maneuvers cover most of the simple activities you
          might want to undertake on your turn. When it isn't your
          turn, you can typically undertake even simpler activities
          requiring no action with the Director's approval. For
          instance, shouting out a warning to an ally or dropping
          an item so another creature can pick it up require no
          action.</p>
          <p>The Director can limit what kinds of no-action
          activities you can attempt when it isn't your turn. For
          instance, shouting out a warning about an unseen foe to
          an ally on the ally's or the foe's turn requires no
          action. But the Director might stop you from giving that
          ally complex tactical advice, saying that doing so
          instead requires a free maneuver on your turn.</p>

    <section id="movement" class="level3">
      <h3>MOVEMENT</h3>
      <p>During combat, creatures can employ multiple mechanics
      that allow them to move around the battlefield. The most
      common of those mechanics is to use your move action on your
      turn, but abilities granted by your class, equipment,
      ancestry, title, or other options might allow you other ways
      to move.</p>
      <p>Your hero starts with a speed based on their
      ancestry—usually 5. This represents the maximum number of
      squares you can move when you take the move action or when
      another effect allows you to move. Your speed can be
      increased by your kit and other game options.</p>
      <p>All squares adjacent to your character cost 1 movement to
      move into. No, there is no Pythagorean theorem on the grid.
      It's a game, don't overthink it.</p>
      <p>You can move freely through an allied creature's space.
      You can move through an enemy creature's space, but it counts
      as difficult terrain (see Difficult Terrain). You can't stop
      moving in any other creature's space, including making an
      attack or using an action or maneuver while in that space and
      then continuing your move.</p>
      <p>A creature can break up their movement granted by their
      move action with their maneuver and action however they
      wish.</p>
      <section id="cant-exceed-speed" class="level4">
        <h4>CAN'T EXCEED SPEED</h4>
        <p>A single move or other effect can never allow a creature
        to move more squares than their speed, unless the effect
        specifically states otherwise. For example, a creature with
        a speed of 5 might have that speed halved to 2. If an ally
        then targets them with an effect that allows them to move
        up to 3 squares, the creature can move only 2 squares
        because that's their current speed.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="shifting" class="level4">
        <h4>SHIFTING</h4>
        <p>Whenever you use your move action or when another effect
        allows you to move, you can instead shift to use up to half
        the maximum squares of movement the effect allows. Whenever
        you shift, creatures can't make opportunity attacks against
        you during your movement (see Free Strikes).</p>
        <p>Certain effects might also allow you to shift a specific
        number of squares, including many effects that let you
        shift up to your speed.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="movement-types" class="level4">
        <h4>MOVEMENT TYPES</h4>

        teleport.</p>
        <section id="walk" class="level5">
          <h5>WALK</h5>
          <p>Walking is the most common movement type, whether it
          refers to ambulating on legs, slithering, or some other
          default method of movement. Unless specified otherwise,

        <section id="burrow" class="level5">
          <h5>BURROW</h5>
          <p>A creature with “burrow” in their speed entry can move
          through dirt vertically or horizontally, and either has
          the means to breathe while doing so or doesn't require
          air to live. Such creatures can't move through more solid
          ground, such as stone, unless their stat block says
          otherwise.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="climb-or-swim" class="level5">
          <h5>CLIMB OR SWIM</h5>
          <p>If a creature's speed entry includes the word “climb,”
          they can climb across vertical and horizontal surfaces at
          full speed. Likewise, if a creature has “swim” in their
          speed entry, they can swim in liquid at full speed.</p>
          <p>Creatures without those types of movement can still
          climb or swim when a rule allows them to move, but each
          square of climbing or swimming costs 2 squares of
          movement. If a surface is difficult to climb (for
          instance, a sheer cliff or ice-covered wall) or a liquid
          is hard to swim through (a raging river or whirlpool),
          the Director can call for a Might test. On a failure, a
          creature can't climb or swim but wastes no movement in
          the attempt. The Director can also impose other
          consequences to failure, such as being caught in the
          spinning current of a whirlpool.</p>

          <p><strong>Power Roll + Might or Agility:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>11 or lower: You fall off the creature into an

          can also hover in midair. If a flying creature is knocked
          prone or has their speed reduced to 0, they fall (see
          Falling).</p>

          <h5>TELEPORT</h5>
          <p>When you teleport, you move from one space to another
          space instantaneously. The following rules apply to
          teleporting:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Teleporting doesn't provoke opportunity
            attacks.</li>
            <li>When you teleport, you bypass any obstacles between
            the space you leave and your destination space.</li>
            <li>The creature teleporting you must have line of
            effect from the space you leave and to your destination
            space.</li>
            <li>Your destination space can't be occupied by another
            creature or object.</li>
            <li>You don't spend your movement when you teleport.
            Instead, the effect that lets you teleport tells you
            how far you can teleport.</li>
            <li>If you teleport while prone, you can be standing
            when you reach your destination space provided you are
            able to stand. If another creature teleports you, it is
            up to them if you remain prone or stand, provided you
            are able.</li>
            <li>If you teleport while affected by the grabbed or
            restrained conditions, those conditions end for
            you.</li>

        <h4>DIFFICULT TERRAIN</h4>
        <p>Areas of thick underbrush, rubble, spiderwebs, or other
        obstacles to movement create difficult terrain. It costs 1
        additional square of movement to enter a square of
        difficult terrain.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="high-ground" class="level4">
        <h4>HIGH GROUND</h4>
        <p>When you make an attack against a creature or object and
        you occupy a space that is fully above the space the target
        takes up, with the bottom of your space higher than the top
        of the target's space, you gain an edge on the power roll
        against that target.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="forced-movement" class="level4">
        <h4>FORCED MOVEMENT</h4>
        <p>Some actions and maneuvers allow you to push, pull, or
        slide another creature a specific distance across the
        battlefield. Collectively, these types of movement are
        called forced movement:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Push X:</strong> You move the target up to X
          squares away from you in a straight line, without moving
          them vertically.</li>
          <li><strong>Pull X:</strong> You move the target up to X
          squares toward you in a straight line, without moving
          them vertically. Each square you move the creature must
          bring them closer to you.</li>
          <li><strong>Slide X:</strong> You move the target up to X
          squares in any direction, except for vertically.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you force move a target, you can always move that
        target fewer squares than the number indicated. For
        example, when the conduit gets a tier 3 “push 5” result
        with their Thunder of the Divine ability, they can push
        targets any distance up to 5 squares, including choosing to
        not move certain targets at all.</p>
        <p>Forced movement ignores difficult terrain and never
        provokes opportunity attacks. When you force move a target
        into damaging terrain or into terrain that produces an
        effect, they are affected as if they had moved into it
        willingly.</p>
        <section id="vertical" class="level5">
          <h5>VERTICAL</h5>
          <p>If a forced movement effect has the word “vertical” in
          front of it, then the forced movement can move a target
          up or down in addition to horizontally. For example, if a
          forced movement effect says “vertical push 5,” then the
          creature targeted by the effect can be pushed up to 5
          squares in any direction, as long as the forced movement
          is a straight line.</p>
          <p>If a creature who can't fly is left in midair at the
          end of a vertical forced move, they fall.</p>
          <p>Though you can't push, pull, or slide a creature
          unless that forced movement specifies “vertical,” you can
          move them along a slope. For a creature to be force moved
          along a slope, each square of the slope can be no more
          than 1 square higher or lower than the previous
          square.</p>

          <h5>SLAMMING INTO CREATURES</h5>
          <p>When you force move a creature into another creature,
          the movement ends and both creatures take 1 damage for
          each square remaining in the first creature's forced
          movement. You can also force move an object into a
          creature. The object's movement ends and the creature
          takes 1 damage for each square remaining in the object's
          forced movement.</p>
          <p>It is possible to move a creature or object of a
          larger size into several creatures of a smaller size at
          the same time. When this happens, all creatures in the
          collision take damage once.</p>
          <p>If a creature is killed by damage from an attack or
          effect that force moves them, the second creature still
          takes damage unless the Director deems otherwise.</p>

            webs, magical hazards, and the like for creatures to be
            thrown into, thrown off of, or thrown through. You'll
            want most of your battles to take place in environments
            with plenty of space to move around, avoiding a lot of

        Kits).</p>
        <p>A melee weapon free strike is a melee attack made with
        an unarmed strike or an improvised weapon. A ranged weapon
        free strike is a ranged attack made with an improvised
        weapon. At the Director's discretion, the damage type of an
        improvised weapon can change based on the object used. For
        example, if you use a burning torch as an improvised

      <h3>FLANKING</h3>
      <p>When you and at least one ally are adjacent to the same
      enemy and on completely opposite sides of the enemy, you are
      flanking that enemy. While flanking an enemy, you gain an
      edge on melee attacks against them.</p>
      <p>If you're unsure whether your hero and an ally are
      flanking a foe, imagine a line extending from the center of
      your space to your ally's space. If that line passes through
      opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, then you and
      your ally are flanking the enemy.</p>

      <h3>DAMAGE</h3>
      <p>Whenever you take damage, you reduce your Stamina by an
      amount equal to the damage taken.</p>
      <section id="damage-types" class="level4">
        <h4>DAMAGE TYPES</h4>
        <p>Typical damage, such as that caused by weapons, falling,
        traps, and monstrous claws, has no type associated with it.
        That's because for most creatures, there's no difference in
        the amount of harm caused by being run through with a pike,
        dropped from a height onto a stone floor, slashed by a
        pendulum scythe, or skewered on a minotaur's horns.
        However, when it comes to elemental and magical damage
        sources, some creatures might have an immunity or weakness
        to that damage. As such, attacks and effects note when they
        deal any of the following damage types: acid, cold,
        corruption, fire, holy, lightning, poison, psychic, or
        sonic.</p>
        <section id="damage-immunity" class="level5">
          <h5>DAMAGE IMMUNITY</h5>
          <p>Damage immunity means that a creature can ignore some
          or all of the damage they would usually take from certain
          attacks or effects.</p>
          <p>Damage immunity might have a damage type associated
          with it, expressed as “[damage type] immunity.”
          Alternatively, damage immunity might apply to any powers
          that deal damage with the Weapon, Magic, or Psionic
          keyword. Damage immunity of either kind often has a value
          associated with it, so that one creature's stat block
          notes “fire immunity 5,” while another creature has
          “Magic immunity 5.”</p>
          <p>Whenever a target with damage immunity takes damage of
          the indicated type or from a power with the indicated
          keyword, they reduce the damage by the value of the
          immunity (to a minimum of 0 damage). If the value of the
          immunity is “all,” then the target takes no damage of the
          indicated type or from those powers.</p>
          <p>Certain creatures also have forced move damage
          immunity. Whenever they take damage from forced movement,
          that damage is reduced by a number equal to their
          immunity.</p>
          <p>Damage immunity should be the last thing applied when
          calculating damage. For instance, if your hero has Weapon
          immunity 5 and takes 8 damage from a weapon attack, you
          would take 3 damage. If a tactician first halved the
          damage you take with the Parry triggered action, you
          would take 4 damage from the attack before immunity is
          applied, with immunity then reducing the damage to 0.</p>
          <p>If multiple damage immunities apply to a source of
          damage, only the immunity with the highest value
          applies.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="damage-weakness" class="level5">
          <h5>DAMAGE WEAKNESS</h5>
          <p>Damage weakness works like damage immunity, except
          that creatures take extra damage whenever they take
          damage of the indicated type, or from a source with the
          indicated keyword. For instance, if a creature has fire
          weakness 5 and is dealt 10 fire damage, they take 15 fire
          damage instead.</p>
          <p>A creature who has “damage weakness X” with no
          specific type or keyword indicated has weakness of the
          indicated amount when they take damage of any type.</p>
          <p>If you have both damage immunity and weakness applied
          to a source of damage, apply both. First apply weakness,
          then immunities.</p>

    <section id="stamina" class="level3">
      <h3>STAMINA</h3>
      <p>Your hero's survivability is represented by your
      <strong>Stamina</strong>. Think of Stamina as a combination
      of a creature's physical vitality and their overall energy
      for dodging and resisting incoming blows, spells, and other
      violence. It's not that every instance of damage deals a
      bleeding wound to you, but that each one chips away at your
      ability to fight effectively. An attack might make you sweat
      as you leap back to avoid an arrow, while another might just
      graze your elbow with a dagger nick, leaving a dull,
      distracting pain. Eventually, though, this draining of energy
      leaves you open for bigger blows that can truly harm your
      body—or possibly kill you.</p>
      <p>After any damage you take is reduced by damage immunity or
      other effects, your Stamina is reduced by an amount equal to
      the remaining damage. Some effects can also reduce your
      Stamina maximum, limiting the amount of Stamina you can
      regain.</p>
      <section id="recoveries-and-recovery-value" class="level4">
        <h4>RECOVERIES AND RECOVERY VALUE</h4>
        <p>Each hero has a number of Recoveries determined by their
        class. A hero also has a recovery value that equals
        one-third of their Stamina, rounded down. When you use the
        Catch Breath action (see Actions), you spend a Recovery and
        regain Stamina equal to your recovery value. Outside of
        combat, you can spend as many Recoveries as you have
        remaining. Some abilities, items, and other effects allow
        you to spend a Recovery to regain Stamina equal to your
        recovery value plus a little extra (as described by the
        effect), or to regain Stamina without spending a
        Recovery.</p>

        <p>Your winded value equals half your Stamina maximum. When
        your Stamina is equal to or less than your winded value,
        you are winded. Although being winded has no effects on its
        own, certain ancestry, class, item, and title abilities
        affect winded creatures.</p>
        <p>You can tell when other creatures are winded and vice

      <section id="dying-and-death" class="level4">
        <h4>DYING AND DEATH</h4>
        <p>When your Stamina is 0 or lower, you are dying. While
        dying, you can't take the Catch Breath action in combat,
        and whenever you make a test using Might or Agility, make
        an attack, or use an action, maneuver, or a triggered
        action, you lose 1d6 Stamina after the action, maneuver, or
        triggered action is resolved. This Stamina loss can't be
        prevented in any way. While you are dying, your allies can
        help you spend recoveries in combat, and you can spend
        Recoveries out of combat as usual.</p>
        <p>While your Stamina is lower than 0, if it reaches the
        negative of your winded value, you die. When you die, you
        can't be brought back to life without the use of a special
        powerful item such as a Scroll of Resurrection.</p>

        <p>Director-controlled creatures remain unconscious for 1
        hour if no one does anything to end that condition. They
        then gain 1 Stamina and their unconsciousness ends. Heroes
        remain unconscious for 1 hour if no one does anything to
        end that condition. After 1 hour, they can spend a Recovery
        and end their unconsciousness. If the hero has no

      <section id="temporary-stamina" class="level4">
        <h4>TEMPORARY STAMINA</h4>
        <p>Some abilities, treasures, and other effects grant a
        creature temporary Stamina. Temporary Stamina shouldn't be
        included in a creature's Stamina total when figuring out a
        creature's recovery value or winded value. If you have
        temporary Stamina while winded, dying, or dead, the
        temporary Stamina doesn't change those states.</p>
        <p>Whenever you take damage while you have temporary
        Stamina, the temporary Stamina decreases first, and any
        leftover damage is applied to your Stamina as usual. For
        instance, if you have 10 temporary Stamina and take 16
        damage, you lose the temporary Stamina and then lose
        another 6 Stamina.</p>
        <p>There is no maximum to how much temporary Stamina you
        can have. Regaining Stamina can't restore temporary
        Stamina. If you have temporary Stamina and then gain more
        temporary Stamina, you get whichever amount of temporary
        Stamina is greater, rather than adding the two pools
        together. For instance, if an ability grants you 10
        temporary Stamina when you already have 5, you have 10
        temporary Stamina, not 15.</p>
        <p>Unless otherwise indicated, temporary Stamina disappears
        when you finish a Respite.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="object-stamina" class="level4">
        <h4>OBJECT STAMINA</h4>
        <p>Mundane objects in the game have Stamina based on the
        material they're made of. When an object's Stamina is
        reduced to 0, the object is destroyed. Objects have damage
        immunity to all poison and psychic damage. Objects made of
        common materials have Stamina as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A size 1 object or 1 square of a larger object made
          of glass has 1 Stamina.</li>
          <li>A size 1 object or 1 square of a larger object made
          of wood has 3 Stamina.</li>
          <li>A size 1 object or 1 square of a larger object made
          of stone has 6 Stamina.</li>
          <li>A size 1 object or 1 square of a larger object made
          of metal has 9 Stamina.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Director can decide that a well-made or poorly made
        object has more or less Stamina. Destroying a supernatural
        object often (but not always) requires a specific quest,
        such as throwing a magic ring back into the volcano where
        it was forged.</p>

      want it to.</p>
      <section id="how-combat-ends" class="level4">
        <h4>HOW COMBAT ENDS</h4>
        <p>The Director determines when a combat encounter is over.
        While some battles—especially showdowns with important
        villains—can be about a fight to the bitter end, many other
        encounters can become a slog if the heroes need to fight
        until every last enemy's Stamina is reduced to 0.</p>
        <p>To avoid a battle dragging, the Director can set
        objectives when they build the encounter. Once the heroes
        achieve those objectives, or if it becomes clear that they
        can win the fight with minimal effort, the Director can end
        the encounter. They might do so by calling “Cut!” like a
        film director, or can use some other phrase or
        indicator.</p>
        <p>When the Director ends combat this way, the players
        typically choose how the battle ends by narrating a
        dramatic finish. Or in rarer cases when the heroes achieve
        a major objective that sets off a story-defining event, the
        Director narrates the end of the battle with a positive
        outcome for the players, called an event ending (see
        below).</p>
        <section id="fleeing-foes" class="level5">
          <h5>FLEEING FOES</h5>
          <blockquote>
            <p>If you've played an RPG like this one before, odds
            are you've had an encounter where you didn't chase down
            every last fleeing foe—and then one such foe grabbed
            another bunch of evil buddies and came back to ambush
            you. It takes only one experience like this to create
            players who promise, “No survivors. No mercy!” whenever
            foes break ranks. Chasing down every last foe can be
            fun once in a while, but it can easily turn a tactical
            encounter into a slog.</p>
            <p>Luckily, this is a heroic game. Although the
            Director can surprise the players with dramatic reveals
            and twisty-turny stories, “Gotcha!” moments that make
            players suspicious of every fleeing bandit shouldn't be
            part of those stories. If a bandit is fleeing an
            encounter, they're running away to rethink their life.
            If they're going for help, the players should get some
            sense of that—for example, the bandit screaming at the
            top of their lungs as they run toward their leader's
            tent. That way, the players can process what's
            happening, and will understand that stopping that
            fleeing bandit is part of the challenge of the
            encounter.</p>

        <p>While planning a combat encounter, the Director can set
        one or more objectives the heroes can achieve to end the
        encounter without dropping every last foe. Some broad
        categories of objectives are described in this section, but
        the Director should feel free to create their own. As well,
        Directors can always end combat anytime it becomes clear
        that the heroes are going to win an encounter with minimal
        effort, even if they haven't achieved all the
        objectives.</p>
        <section id="diminish-numbers" class="level5">
          <h5>DIMINISH NUMBERS</h5>
          <p>Sometimes the heroes simply defeat enough of their
          enemies that the rest don't stand a chance. For example,
          the Director might decide that an encounter ends when the
          heroes have no non-minion enemies remaining, when the
          heroes outnumber their foes, or when the number of
          remaining enemies is half of what it was at the start of
          the encounter.</p>
          <p>The Director can also use the following guideline to
          determine when it's time to call “Cut!” if one of the
          encounter's objectives is for the heroes to diminish
          their foes. At the end of a round of combat with no
          living solo or boss creatures (see the Bestiary), the
          Director should add up the levels of all the enemies who
          oppose the heroes. Minions count as 1/5 of their listed
          level for this purpose. Then the Director adds the levels
          of all the remaining heroes who aren't dying together. If
          the combined level of the heroes is twice or more than
          the combined level of their enemies, the Director should
          end combat.</p>

        <section id="defeat-specific-foe" class="level5">

          <p>A combat encounter might include one or more of the

          captain leading a group of mercenaries, or one or more
          particularly powerful foes among a group of weaker ones,
          such as a pair of tusker demons in a gnoll war band.
          Because these enemies are the stars of the encounter, if
          only weak foes are left once the stars are gone, the
          battle loses its challenge and it's time to wrap it up.
          Under such circumstances, the Director can end the combat

          <h5>GET THE THING!</h5>
          <p>Classic heroic fantasy is full of important objects
          that the heroes must protect from the forces of evil:
          magic rings, royal birth certificates, dragon eggs, and
          the like. Heroes often find themselves at violent odds
          with their enemies as they race to collect a valuable or
          important item from a guarded temple or castle, or when
          they need to steal the item from a group of enemies
          already in possession of it.</p>
          <p>Objectives in this category work well when paired with
          other objectives. For instance, the heroes must steal a
          ledger containing a record of criminal activity from an
          overmind and her lackeys. However, even if they obtain
          the ledger, the battle won't be over until they also
          defeat the overmind, who won't let the book go without a
          fight!</p>

          <p>Combat doesn't always have to be about destroying your
          enemies. Sometimes it's about destroying their stuff!
          Burning a pirate captain's vessel, closing a portal to
          the Abyssal Wasteland before it lets in an army of
          demons, or shutting down a massive kobold trap made of
          spinning blades could so hamper the heroes' foes that the

          <p>No one earns the mantle of hero without saving a few
          lives. If the heroes rescue a powerful ally from the
          clutches of their foes during combat, the added strength
          of that ally might be enough to make the remainder of the
          encounter trivial. When you and your allies save a

          innocent villagers time to escape. They might need to
          hold off wave after wave of zombies while a group of
          priests completes a ritual to lay the undead to rest for

        <section id="stop-the-action" class="level5">
          <h5>STOP THE ACTION</h5>
          <p>Sometimes combat is complicated by the fact that the
          heroes need to stop the villainous actions of their foes.
          It's not enough to simply defeat the warriors in a cult.
          The heroes must also stop the zealots'
          archdevil-summoning ritual! Or it might be that the
          heroes need to interrupt a wedding and make sure an evil
          mage doesn't marry the heir to the throne. Despite
          combat, the mage forces the ceremony to continue!</p>
          <p>Objectives in this category often have a timer
          associated with them. If the heroes don't achieve the
          objective in a certain number of rounds, the conditions
          of the battle should change. For instance, if the
          cultists summon the archdevil, defeating the devil
          suddenly becomes the heroes' new objective!</p>

          <h5>MAKING OBJECTIVES KNOWN</h5>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Encounters work best if the players have a good idea
            of what they are working toward. The Director doesn't
            need to state objectives outright to the players at the
            start of the battle, though they can if they like. Not
            all groups want to start combat with the Director
            saying, “Your objectives are to break the eldritch
            machine and destroy the vampire lord,” because doing so
            might take the players out of the game's narrative.</p>
            <p>In many combat encounters, the objectives are
            obvious. For instance, in a battle against a
            necromancer controlling a horde of undead minions, the
            players probably don't need to be told that defeating
            the necromancer ends the encounter when that's an easy
            assumption. In an encounter against cultists performing
            a world-ending ritual, the heroes can guess that
            stopping the ritual is one of their objectives. In
            fact, they probably went on this adventure to
            specifically achieve that objective. They're not there
            for karaoke at the end of existence!</p>
            <p>Not all objectives are so clear, however. In a
            battle against a goblin cursespitter, a kobold
            legionary, and three human knaves guarding the entrance
            to a bandit fortress, it can be difficult to know what
            the exact objective of the encounter is, beyond “Defeat
            them all!” The objective could be to simply diminish
            the enemy forces, but it could also be the case that
            the cursespitter leads the group, so that defeating the
            goblin causes the other forces to fall apart. In such a
            case, it helps if the Director provides at least a hint
            of that setup at the start of the battle. The
            cursespitter could clearly issue orders and even call
            the other bandits cowards, demanding that they not “run
            away like last time!”</p>

          <p>The opposite of “Stop the Action,” this objective
          ending sees the characters charged with initiating an
          event, performing a ritual, and so forth. For instance,
          if the heroes are attempting to launch an airship while
          repelling a time raider boarding party, the encounter
          could be over the moment the heroes manage to activate

          enemy down to 0 Stamina. When the heroes are challenged
          to defeat specific foes or take other actions while
          trying not to die, those objectives can make an encounter
          easier than the encounter rules would usually dictate. As

          bit.</p>

        <h4>DRAMATIC FINISH</h4>
        <p>If the heroes are able to end a fight with a dramatic
        finish, the Director assigns each hero one or more of their
        remaining enemies, then asks that hero's player to describe
        how the hero neutralizes that enemy. The hero might deliver
        a killing blow, knock their foe out, or let the enemy flee
        with their tail between their legs (literally or
        figuratively). If the fight has more heroes than Director
        controlled enemies, the Director can assign more than one
        hero to an enemy, then ask the players how their characters
        work together to bring that enemy down. After everyone
        gives a description, the battle ends.</p>

        <p>If the Director calls the end of combat when a specific

        creates a big narrative finish. The Director can pick a
        narrative trigger for an event ending before an encounter
        begins, or can come up with one on the fly if that makes
        more sense.</p>
        <p>Event endings can cover big scenarios, such as the
        characters destroying a dam to unleash a river upon their
        enemies, or completing a ritual that sends all the demons
        they've been battling back to the Abyssal Wasteland. These
        endings should be accompanied by vivid visual details. For
        example, if the heroes are battling a necromancer
        controlling a horde of zombies, the undead might crumble to
        dust upon the necromancer's defeat. Similarly, if the
        heroes destroy an eldritch machine sapping the land of its
        natural energy, the shockwave from its destruction could
        vaporize the cultists trying to protect it.</p>

            <p>For players who enjoy fighting to the bitter end
            rather than ending combat early, the Director can use
            this <strong>optional rule</strong> to bring things to
            a quicker conclusion. When it's clear that the heroes
            are going to win a battle, their enemies are overcome
            with fear, despair, and panic. In this weakened state,
            each enemy's Stamina drops to 1, and each minion has a
            damage threshold of 1. The heroes can then swiftly
            finish off the remaining foes, getting the satisfaction
            of total annihilation through dice rolls.</p>

  <section id="negotiation" class="level2">
    <h2>NEGOTIATION</h2>
    <p>Negotiation gives the heroes a chance to get what they want
    without combat … or at least without further combat! You might
    negotiate with a king to obtain military support against an
    incursion of demons in a neighboring country. You could enter
    into talks with a bandit leader to convince her to stop
    attacking merchant caravans on the road, and instead target
    nobles loyal to a tyrant. You might attempt to convince an
    archmage to allow you access to their secret library so you can
    research the location of a dragon-slaying axe. Negotiation
    covers all these scenarios and more.</p>
    <p>Think of negotiation as something like learning a new system
    for combat, exploration, or investigation in an RPG. This set
    of rules provides a framework for roleplaying. The negotiation
    rules are meant to be read by players and Directors, so that
    both understand the rules of negotiation. If a player hasn't
    read these rules, the Director and other players who have can
    explain them to that player during their first negotiation.</p>
    <section id="when-to-negotiate" class="level3">
      <h3>WHEN TO NEGOTIATE</h3>
      <p>In order for a negotiation to occur, an NPC must have an
      interest in negotiating with the heroes—but must also have a
      reason to not simply jump on board with whatever the heroes
      propose. Negotiations happen only when an NPC has that
      internal tension between interest and reluctance. For
      example, if the characters ask a king to send his army into a
      neighboring kingdom to battle a demon incursion, the king
      needs to be conflicted. He wants to stop the incursion, but
      he doesn't want to risk the lives of his soldiers defending a
      foreign nation while leaving their own people unprotected. If
      the heroes want the help of the king's army, they need to
      negotiate.</p>
      <p>Heroes aren't expected to use the negotiation rules every
      time one character tries to convince an NPC to see things
      their way. For instance, if a hero wants information about a
      cult leader from a captured cultist, a single Presence test
      using the Lie skill or a Might test using Intimidate is
      likely all that's needed. A character who wants to flirt with
      the local alchemist to obtain a free Healing Potion likely
      just needs to make a Presence test using the Flirt skill.</p>
      <p>By contrast, negotiations typically involve all the heroes
      interacting with one or more important named NPCs who can
      provide information, items, or services that dramatically
      change the course of an adventure. Often, this involves the
      heroes seeking an item of great power, a retainer or
      companion, the services of an influential organization or
      nation, or a plot-twist-worthy piece of information.
      Convincing a lich to lend the party the legendary Codex
      Mortis, trying to convince a dragon to halt an attack on a
      wizard's tower, or talking the leaders of an enemy army into
      standing down means that a negotiation is in order.</p>
      <p>To negotiate successfully, the heroes must make persuasive
      arguments to convince NPCs to do what they want. “Do it or we
      kill you” is a threat that might well accompany a single
      Might test using the Intimidate skill, but it's not a
      negotiating tactic.</p>
      <section id="limits-of-negotiation" class="level4">
        <h4>LIMITS OF NEGOTIATION</h4>
        <p>Some players might instinctively feel that the
        negotiation rules should give them something akin to
        mind-control superpowers. They're not used to imagining
        NPCs complexly, and might attempt to negotiate in
        situations where negotiation is either completely
        unreasonable or literally impossible. No matter how
        persuasive or well spoken a hero is, there's no argument to
        be made that might convince the vile Lord Syuul to give up
        his pursuit of evil and become a gardener. A negotiation
        typically can't convince a queen to hand over her crown to
        the heroes and name them the new rulers of the land, or
        inspire a dragon to fork over every piece of treasure in
        their hoard.</p>
        <p>Negotiations only work when the heroes ask for something
        from an NPC that the NPC is willing to seriously consider
        giving them.</p>
        <p><strong>Negotiation is not a process that changes an
        NPC's character.</strong> Rather, the heroes are trying to
        make an NPC understand how behaving differently would be in
        character. You might well be able to get the hitherto loyal
        lieutenant of an evil boss to reconsider the error of their
        ways. That's a classic dramatic trope. But even then,
        you're not changing their character—you're convincing them
        that their current evil ways are out of character. “Is this
        who you are? Is this how you want to be remembered?!”</p>
        <p>If some players want to use the negotiation system as a
        means to an end by having their characters say, “Just do
        what we tell you, or else!,” you can remind them that
        that's not how most people, including NPCs, work. Any
        heroes who open with that attitude are likely to lose the
        negotiation before it begins.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="the-threat-of-violence" class="level4">
        <h4>THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE</h4>
        <p>In the real world, negotiations rarely come with a
        threat of immediate violence. Ambassadors don't usually get
        into fistfights. But this is a heroic fantasy RPG,
        featuring heroes who are armed to the teeth and able to
        alter reality with their minds. The threat of violence is
        already implied. Everyone involved knows that the
        characters could draw steel at any moment.</p>
        <p>The Director typically assumes that the underlying
        potential for events to turn violent is already factored
        into every negotiation. However, if the heroes decide to
        bring that threat to the forefront, then they've exited the
        realm of negotiation and have entered into a different type
        of relationship—and it's probably time to determine
        initiative.</p>
        <p>Negotiation is about persuading someone to help you
        willingly because you've convinced them that meeting your
        objectives is a good idea. Working with you is wise or
        logical, or might make them look good. A hero can
        absolutely threaten someone with violence and force them to
        do what they want, but this is an incredibly temporary
        state. A threatened NPC isn't willingly doing what they've
        been asked. They're doing it on threat of violence, and
        will comply only while that threat is evident—after which,
        they'll likely go back to their previous behavior as soon
        as they think they can get away with it.</p>

      <p>During negotiation, the Director assigns NPCs four
      temporary statistics—interest, patience, motivations, and
      pitfalls. The heroes can strike a favorable deal if they
      maximize an NPC's interest by making arguments that invoke
      the NPC's motivations and avoid their pitfalls—but they have
      to do all that before the NPC's patience wears out.</p>
      <section id="interest" class="level4">
        <h4>INTEREST</h4>
        <p>An NPC's interest represents how eager they are to make
        a deal with the heroes. Interest is graded on a scale of 0
        (no interest) to 5 (the most possible interest). When a
        negotiation begins, an NPC's interest is between 1 and 4.
        If the NPC's interest goes to 5, they make a final offer
        and the negotiation ends (see <em>Keep Going or Stop</em>,
        below). If the NPC's interest drops to 0, they end a
        negotiation without offering the heroes any deal.</p>

        <h4>PATIENCE</h4>
        <p>An NPC's patience represents how much time and effort
        they're willing to devote to a negotiation. Patience is
        graded on a scale of 0 to 5, with each NPC starting a
        negotiation with their patience higher than 0. If an NPC's
        patience reaches 0, the NPC makes a final offer and
        negotiation ends (see <em>Keep Going or Stop</em>).</p>

          the NPC's patience increases by 1 at the start of the
          negotiation (to a maximum of 5). If three or more heroes
          negotiating with an NPC speak the NPC's native language,

        <section id="benevolence" class="level5">
          <h5>BENEVOLENCE</h5>
          <p>An NPC with the benevolence motivation believes in
          sharing what they have with others. However, an NPC
          involved in a negotiation must be limited in their
          benevolence, so that they don't just give the heroes what
          they need.</p>
          <p>Sometimes an NPC's benevolence might extend only to a
          specific group of people, so that a benevolent pirate
          captain might share their plunder freely with the rest of
          their crew—but they're still plundering! Other times, an
          NPC's charity might be limited by the fact that they
          don't have much to give. A benevolent NPC might be
          hesitant to give the heroes help because they believe
          their limited resources are more necessary or could do
          more good somewhere else.</p>
          <p>An NPC with the benevolence pitfall has a cynical view
          of the world, believing that no creature has a right to
          anything just by being alive. The idea of helping others
          because it's the right thing to do is a preposterous,
          immature, or inexperienced idea to be laughed off or
          snuffed out.</p>
          <p>Arguments that appeal to a benevolence motivation
          contend that if the NPC strikes a deal with the heroes,
          the people the NPC cares about will benefit from the
          deal. Example arguments include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“If you lend us the Sword of Agathor, we can make
            Capital safer for your guild by using it to lay your
            enemies low.”</li>
            <li>“If you can teleport us into the dragon's cave,
            we'll give you half the wyrm's hoard once we cut off
            the creature's head. That could benefit generations of
            students at your academy!”</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="discovery" class="level5">
          <h5>DISCOVERY</h5>
          <p>An NPC with the discovery motivation wants to learn
          new lore, explore forgotten places, break ground with new
          experiments, or uncover artifacts lost to time. Their
          curiosity and quest for knowledge might be driven by a
          specific goal, such as seeking the cure for a rare
          disease or a portal to a specific far-off world. Or it
          could be that they are a naturally inquisitive person who
          just wants to understand all they can about the
          timescape.</p>
          <p>An NPC with the discovery pitfall has no interest in
          finding new places, peoples, or ideas. It might be that
          the unknown scares them or makes them so uncomfortable
          that they'd rather remain ignorant. Alternatively, a
          previous pursuit of discovery might have turned out
          poorly for them.</p>
          <p>Arguments that appeal to a discovery motivation
          contend that striking a deal with the heroes will allow
          the NPC to gain new knowledge or acquire unique property.
          Example arguments include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“Allow us to use your cipher to translate the only
            copy of the <em>Codex Mortis</em>, and then we'll let
            you read the book when we're done.”</li>
            <li>“We know the journey to Decant Isle is dangerous,
            but we're going into uncharted territory. We thought
            that your crew of sailors might want to be among the
            few mortals to lay eyes on the place.”</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="freedom" class="level5">
          <h5>FREEDOM</h5>
          <p>An NPC with the freedom motivation wants no authority
          above them and desires no authority over others. They
          might already have personal freedom and wish to maintain
          that status quo, or they might wish to liberate themself
          or others from someone else's authority.</p>
          <p>An NPC with the freedom pitfall believes that a world
          without authority is one in turmoil and chaos. They might
          even believe that they are the right person to rule, and
          that their ideals should be the ones that become the law
          of the land.</p>
          <p>Arguments that appeal to a freedom motivation contend
          that helping the heroes will maintain or grant freedom to
          the NPC or other people. Example arguments include the
          following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“I know you want to see the queen's authority
            revoked forever. She has no heirs. Give us the key to
            her study so that we can prove her corruption and give
            you a chance to topple the monarchy henceforth.”</li>
            <li>“If you promise to give us ten vials of Assassin's
            Kiss, we'll see to it that the baron's prison is
            emptied.”</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="greed" class="level5">
          <h5>GREED</h5>
          <p>An NPC with the greed motivation desires wealth and
          resources above almost anything else. Sometimes these
          NPCs are misers, much like wyrms who hoard coins and gems
          but never spend or donate them. Others flaunt their
          wealth, viewing it as a sign of their station in life.
          Greed-driven NPCs might share their wealth with a select
          group of people they love, such as a noble lord who
          indulges his children's every desire. Some NPCs might be
          greedy for resources other than money, such as a demon
          who wants to collect and devour souls, or a troll lord
          who hungers endlessly for the flesh of others.</p>
          <p>An NPC with the greed pitfall has no interest in
          accumulating wealth or other resources, and becomes
          offended if anyone tries to buy their participation. They
          hold their ideals above material desires.</p>
          <p>Arguments that appeal to a greed motivation contend
          that helping the heroes will increase the NPC's wealth or
          assets. Example arguments include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“You should help us battle the overmind. Xorranox's
            wealth is legendary, and we'll see to it that you get
            your fair share.”</li>
            <li>“Give us a week to do research among your private
            collection of books, and we'll give you another ten
            unique tomes we found in an ancient star elf
            sanctuary.”</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="higher-authority" class="level5">
          <h5>HIGHER AUTHORITY</h5>
          <p>An NPC with the higher authority motivation remains
          staunchly loyal to a person or force they perceive as
          more important than themself. This higher authority could
          be an organization, a deity or being of great power, a
          formal leader such as a noble or monarch, a mystical
          presence or force the NPC might not fully understand, or
          a person the NPC sees as an informal authority figure (an
          older sibling, a personal hero, and so forth).</p>
          <p>An NPC with the higher authority pitfall scoffs at the
          idea of serving another. The NPC might not believe that
          all people should be free, but they certainly believe
          that they personally shouldn't have to answer to
          anyone.</p>
          <p>Arguments that appeal to a higher authority motivation
          contend that it's in the interest of the higher authority
          for the NPC to strike a deal with the heroes. A hero
          might even tell the NPC that if the higher authority were
          in the NPC's position, they would take the deal. Example
          arguments include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“All great creations honor your god, Malus. If you
            teach me to forge the Hammer of Azdul, that will be a
            great honor to bestow upon your god.”</li>
            <li>“You know what Jarith the Bold would do? He'd guide
            us through the vast wasteland of the desert to reach
            the tower. Will you be our Jarith?”</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="justice" class="level5">
          <h5>JUSTICE</h5>
          <p>An NPC with the justice motivation wants to see the
          righteous rewarded and the wicked punished, however
          subjective their sense of who or what is good and evil. A
          priest who venerates a god of nature might believe that
          all who protect plants and animals are righteous, and
          that those who harvest natural resources as miners and
          lumberjacks must die. Having a justice motivation doesn't
          necessarily make an NPC a kind or charitable person.</p>
          <p>An NPC with the justice pitfall doesn't believe that
          the timescape is an inherently just place, and has no
          interest in making it one. The world is eternal conflict,
          there is no such thing as justice, and anyone who thinks
          otherwise is a naive fool.</p>
          <p>Arguments that appeal to a justice motivation position
          the heroes on the good side of an NPC's sense of right
          and wrong. Example arguments include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“You despise those who steal from nature. Allow us
            peacefully into your wode so we may bottle the Blessed
            Spring's water. We're going to use it to stop an army
            from felling every tree and tearing up the earth
            wherever they go.”</li>
            <li>“You think nobles are lazy barons who get rich off
            the backs of peasants. We want to dethrone Lord Saxton.
            Lend us your crew of thieves, and we'll see to it that
            when Saxton falls, the people can choose their own
            leaders.”</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="legacy" class="level5">
          <h5>LEGACY</h5>
          <p>An NPC with the legacy motivation desires fame while
          alive and acclaim that lasts long after their death. They
          hope others will know and remember their deeds, great or
          terrible. Some of these NPCs might even seek immortality
          through deification or undeath, so that the eventual
          shedding of their mortal coil doesn't prevent them from
          continuing to make history.</p>
          <p>An NPC with a legacy pitfall cares nothing about
          leaving a personal mark on the world. To them, such vain
          thinking is nothing but a waste of time.</p>
          <p>Arguments that appeal to a legacy motivation contend
          that striking a deal with the heroes increases the
          likelihood that people will talk about the NPC for
          centuries to come. Example arguments include the
          following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“If you give us the vizier's itinerary, I'll
            compose a song about your bravery in defying him, then
            sing it in every tavern from here to Ix!”</li>
            <li>“Yes, losing the battle is a possibility. If we do,
            the gnolls will still come for you eventually. But if
            we crush our foes, imagine the honors, the histories,
            the poems, the statues—all of it created for you
            because your siege engines turned the tide.”</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="peace" class="level5">
          <h5>PEACE</h5>
          <p>An NPC with the peace motivation wants calm in their
          life. Under typical circumstances, they want to be left
          alone to run their business, farm, kingdom, criminal
          empire, or whatever small slice of the timescape is
          theirs. Some such NPCs don't have peace and need help
          obtaining it, while others want their peaceful status quo
          to be maintained.</p>
          <p>An NPC with the peace pitfall hates being bored. They
          want excitement, drama, and danger in their life. For
          them, there's nothing worse than the status quo.</p>
          <p>Arguments that appeal to a peace motivation contend
          that helping the heroes will earn the NPC some peace, at
          least for a little while. Example arguments include the
          following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“You have a good thing going here. A little
            burgling of nobles, some alcohol smuggling, and some
            illegal gambling dens. No one's getting hurt, but
            Constable Cofax is closing in on you. We could redirect
            him toward some real danger to the community, if you
            can help us set a trap for the Watchmaker.”</li>
            <li>“I know you don't sell to outsiders, but we need
            that helm. I'm going to use it to turn back a group of
            hobgoblins marching this way. They're not going to be
            as friendly as us.”</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="power" class="level5">
          <h5>POWER</h5>
          <p>An NPC with the power motivation covets the authority
          of others. They want to increase their influence, no
          matter how great it already is, and maintain their
          domain. They might seek power through conquering others,
          the collection of artifacts, or through the infusion of
          supernatural rituals—though why choose one method when
          all three together achieve the best results? Some such
          NPCs are world-traversing tyrants, but the petty
          administrators of village organizations and shrines can
          covet power just as hungrily.</p>
          <p>An NPC with the power pitfall has no interest in
          authority for themself. They might respect the authority
          of others, but they hate the thought of ruling over other
          people and roundly reject any suggestion of the idea.</p>
          <p>Arguments that appeal to a power motivation contend
          that working with the heroes will increase or protect the
          NPC's power. Example arguments include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“Everyone knows you should be running the watch,
            Percy. The old lady's retiring, and our friend Baron
            Kuglar is naming the replacement. Now, you let us into
            the restricted armory, and we'll put in a good
            word.”</li>
            <li>“We know he's your brother, Your Highness, but he's
            older—first in line for the throne. If you help us
            prove he's in a cult, you become the favorite
            son.”</li>

        <section id="npcs-change-over-time" class="level5">
          <h5>NPCS CHANGE OVER TIME</h5>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Just like the heroes, NPCs in negotiations are
            complex individuals who can change over time. It's
            possible that the heroes might have to negotiate with
            the same NPC for several different favors during the
            course of a campaign, over which time the NPC's
            motivations and pitfalls might change. If the heroes
            turn a bandit captain with the greed and power
            motivations into a temporary ally, that criminal might
            learn from them, changing their ways to rob only those
            who exploit the poor and giving those earnings to
            people in need. The next time the heroes negotiate with
            the bandit captain, they have the benevolence and
            protection motivations.</p>

        <section id="protection" class="level5">
          <h5>PROTECTION</h5>
          <p>An NPC with the protection motivation has land,
          people, information, items, or an organization they want
          protected above all else. Keeping their charge safe is a
          duty they hold dear, and aiding in that protection earns
          their favor. Most people have friends or family they wish
          to protect, but an NPC with the protection motivation
          believes in doing so above all else.</p>
          <p>An NPC with the protection pitfall is happy to leave
          others to fend for themselves. They don't believe that
          it's their responsibility to protect anyone other than
          themself, and might be outright disgusted at the thought
          of risking themself or their property to protect
          others.</p>
          <p>Arguments that appeal to a protection motivation
          contend that helping the heroes allows an NPC to better
          protect their charge. Example arguments include the
          following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“Dead soldiers grow the necromancer's ranks. Total
            annihilation is the only way to defeat her. March with
            us now, while her army is small, and we'll defeat her.
            Or…”</li>

        <section id="revelry" class="level5">
          <h5>REVELRY</h5>
          <p>An NPC with the revelry motivation just wants to have
          fun. They enjoy socializing at parties, thrill-seeking,
          or indulging in other hedonistic activities. Getting
          pleasure out of life while spending time with people they
          like is paramount to such NPCs.</p>
          <p>An NPC with the revelry pitfall sees social encounters
          and hedonism as a waste of time. They take pleasure only
          in work or in building their own skills and character.
          Others who suggest immature debauchery are not worth
          their time.</p>
          <p>Arguments that appeal to the revelry motivation
          contend that striking a deal with the heroes will allow
          the NPC to get back to reveling sooner, longer, or
          harder. Example arguments include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“How would you like to have the most exclusive
            songs for your exclusive birthday celebration next
            week? I'll write you a whole original set list, free of
            charge … provided you extend me and my band here an
            invitation.”</li>
            <li>“I know you don't want to forge five Chronokinesis
            Crowns. How's this instead? You do that for me, and
            I'll give you the fourteen kegs of whiskey we found in
            a steel-dwarf ruin. This stuff is old, unique, and
            forget-your-first-name potent. You can crack a keg with
            your friends to celebrate a job well done.”</li>

        <section id="vengeance" class="level5">
          <h5>VENGEANCE</h5>
          <p>An NPC with the vengeance motivation wants to harm
          another who has hurt them. Their desire for revenge could
          be proportional to the harm that was inflicted upon them,
          or they might wish to pay back their pain with interest.
          In some cases, a desire for vengeance can be satisfied
          only by the death of another, but an NPC might wish to
          pay back their own suffering with embarrassment, career
          failure, or some other less permanent pain.</p>
          <p>An NPC with the vengeance pitfall believes that
          revenge solves nothing. They might have gained this
          belief firsthand, or they might simply not have the
          ambition to seek revenge—and they take a dim view of
          others who do.</p>
          <p>Arguments that appeal to the vengeance motivation
          contend that the NPC can gain payback for their pain by
          helping the heroes. Example arguments include the
          following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“The servants of Ajax killed your sister as she
            scoured the city for his cults. The Black Iron Pact
            works for the Overlord. Give us her diaries, and we
            might uncover the pact's hideaway and deal a great blow
            to your hated foes.”</li>
            <li>“That prankster Huckable made your trousers tear at
            the last council meeting. Don't you want to pay him

      <h3>OPENING A NEGOTIATION</h3>
      <p>A negotiation begins when the heroes ask something of an
      NPC and the Director deems that the circumstances require a
      negotiation. Those circumstances always involve the heroes
      requiring assistance that could change the course of the
      adventure, and having the NPC conflicted about working with
      them.</p>
      <section id="stop-combat-start-negotiation" class="level4">
        <h4>STOP COMBAT, START NEGOTIATION</h4>
        <p>If a hero wants to halt hostilities to negotiate with
        the other side, they can use a maneuver to make a hard
        Presence test (or another applicable test, as the Director
        determines) in an attempt to stop combat and start a
        negotiation. The test has a chance of success only if the
        Director believes the other side is willing and capable of
        negotiating. A foe who has the upper hand, who hates the
        heroes beyond measure, or who lacks sapience is unlikely to
        negotiate.</p>

        <h4>STARTING STATS</h4>
        <p>An NPC's starting negotiation stats depend on their
        attitude toward the heroes, as shown on the Negotiation
        Starting Attitudes table, and can be adjusted by the
        Director as they see fit. A naturally irascible NPC might
        have lower patience, while a hostile NPC with a
        greater-than-expected stake in the negotiation topic might
        have a higher-than-typical interest.</p>

      <h3>UNCOVERING MOTIVATIONS</h3>
      <p>If a hero wishes to figure out an NPC's motivations, they
      can begin by simply asking, “What do you want out of this
      deal?” In response, the NPC can willingly hint at or reveal
      one of their motivations, usually by asking for something.
      For instance, a monarch NPC with the greed motivation and a
      penchant for collecting rare animals might suggest that the
      heroes retrieving a griffon egg would earn the monarch's
      gratitude. The Director can also decide that during the
      natural course of the negotiation, the NPC might offer up
      similar suggestions without the heroes asking, provided the
      NPC already has an interest of at least 3.</p>
      <p>If an NPC isn't as forthcoming, or if the heroes want to
      learn one of the NPC's pitfalls, a hero can make a Reason,
      Intuition, or Presence test while interacting with the NPC
      during the negotiation, based on the tactics used to draw out
      the NPC. The test has the following outcomes:</p>
      <p><strong>Power Roll + Reason, Intuition, or
      Presence:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>11 or lower: The hero learns no information regarding
        the NPC's motivations or pitfalls, and the NPC realizes the
        hero is trying to read them and becomes annoyed. As a
        consequence, the NPC's patience is reduced by 1.</li>
        <li>12–16: The hero learns no information regarding the
        NPC's motivations or pitfalls.</li>
        <li>17+: The hero learns one of the NPC's motivations or
        pitfalls (their choice).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After this test is made, the heroes can't make another
      test to determine the same NPC's motivations or pitfalls
      until they make an argument to the NPC or the negotiation
      ends.</p>
      <section id="outside-of-negotiation" class="level4">
        <h4>OUTSIDE OF NEGOTIATION</h4>
        <p>While the heroes can discover an NPC's motivations or
        pitfalls through tests made during negotiation, they can
        employ other methods of investigating motivations or
        pitfalls before negotiation. Research or a little
        reconnaissance (for instance, reading the NPC's diary or
        talking to their closest friends), can reveal quite a bit
        about a person!</p>

    <section id="making-arguments" class="level3">
      <h3>MAKING ARGUMENTS</h3>
      <p>As part of their initial request to an NPC in a
      negotiation, a hero makes an argument as to why the NPC
      should give the heroes what they want. The hero might offer
      to do something in exchange as part of their argument, such
      as clear bandits from a forest, hand over a piece of
      treasure, or slay a dragon for the NPC. Or instead of
      offering something, the hero could attempt to convince the
      NPC that it's in their own best interest to help—or even that
      it's a moral imperative. For example, a hero could appeal to
      a knight's sense of duty, the potential wealth a mercenary
      could make, or the final wish of a queen's dearly departed
      grandmother as part of an argument. NPCs who admire the
      heroes are more likely to respond to compliments and
      buttering up, while those who fear the heroes are more likely
      to respond to intimidation and awe.</p>
      <p>Arguments need a justification as to why they're true.
      “Helping us defeat Lord Saxton is good for you in the long
      run,” is half of an argument, so that the hero also needs to
      explain why this is the case. “Helping us defeat Lord Saxton
      is good for you in the long run, because we know he's coming
      for your kingdom after Bedegar falls!” If a hero makes half
      an argument, the NPC might follow up with questions such as,
      “Why do you say that?” or “What makes you think that's true?”
      to get the full argument from the hero.</p>
      <p>One hero makes an argument to an NPC, but the players can
      discuss the details of the argument out of character
      beforehand. It's up to the group to decide how much
      discussion to have before making an argument, and to decide
      what argument the players think will best sway the NPC.</p>
      <p>This is a good topic for discussion before a group
      actually gets into a negotiation, so everyone knows the other
      players' thoughts. Some groups have the most fun without any
      around-the-table discussion, while others prefer being able
      to strategize as often as possible.</p>
      <section id="appeal-to-motivation" class="level4">
        <h4>APPEAL TO MOTIVATION</h4>
        <p>If an argument doesn't include a pitfall and appeals to
        one of the NPC's motivations that hasn't already been
        appealed to, the hero making the argument can make an easy
        test to attempt to sway the NPC with the argument.
        Depending on the argument, this can be a Reason, Intuition,
        or Presence test using any applicable skill—most commonly a
        skill from the interpersonal skill group. The test has the
        following outcomes:</p>
        <p><strong>Power Roll + Reason, Intuition, or
        Presence:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>11 or lower: The NPC's patience decreases by 1.</li>
          <li>12–16: The NPC's interest increases by 1, and their
          patience decreases by 1.</li>
          <li>17+: The NPC's interest increases by 1, and their
          patience doesn't change.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the Director's discretion, a particularly
        well-roleplayed or well-reasoned argument automatically
        counts as a tier 3 result without a test. Good roleplaying
        should be rewarded!</p>
        <p>If the heroes attempt to appeal to a motivation that's
        already been appealed to, the NPC's interest remains the
        same and their patience decreases by 1.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="no-motivation-or-pitfall" class="level4">
        <h4>NO MOTIVATION OR PITFALL</h4>
        <p>If an argument doesn't include one of the NPC's
        motivations or pitfalls, the hero who makes the argument
        must make a more difficult test to appeal to the NPC. The
        test has the following outcomes:</p>
        <p><strong>Power Roll + Reason, Intuition, or
        Presence:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>11 or lower: The NPC's patience decreases by 1, and
          their interest decreases by 1.</li>
          <li>12–16: The NPC's patience decreases by 1.</li>
          <li>17+: The NPC's interest increases by 1, and their
          patience decreases by 1. (On a natural 19 or 20, the
          NPC's patience remains the same.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the heroes try to use the same argument without a
        pitfall or motivation twice, the test automatically gets a
        tier 1 result.</p>

      </section>
      <section id="renown-and-negotiation" class="level4">
        <h4>RENOWN AND NEGOTIATION</h4>
        <p>During a negotiation, an NPC has an Impression score
        that determines the amount of Renown needed to influence
        them (see Renown). This score only matters if the NPC knows
        of the heroes. A dragon who slumbered away the last hundred
        years and was just woken up to negotiate can't be
        influenced by a hero's Renown. (By the way, it's a terrible
        idea to wake a dragon, even if they do know you're famous.)
        If the NPC does know of the hero and has an Impression that
        is equal to or lower than the hero's Renown, the NPC can be
        influenced by that hero.</p>
        <p>The higher an NPC's Impression, the harder they are to
        influence with Renown. A small-time brigand has a lower
        Impression score than a monarch who meets with powerful and
        famous people all the time. The <strong>NPCs and
        Impression</strong> table provides examples of different
        archetypical NPC Impression scores. If a creature has a
        level, then their Impression equals their level unless the
        Director deems otherwise.</p>

      <h3>NPC RESPONSE AND OFFER</h3>
      <p>After a hero makes an argument, the NPC responds in one of
      three ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An NPC responds positively if the heroes increase the
        NPC's interest. “That's an excellent point.” “You've given
        me much to consider.” “Fair enough.” “Makes sense to
        me.”</li>
        <li>An NPC responds negatively if the heroes decrease their
        interest. “I don't buy that.” “Poppycock!” “I hear you, but
        I disagree.” “That's not going to sway me.”</li>
        <li>An NPC responds with impatience if the heroes fail to
        increase or decrease their interest. “I've heard that
        before.” “Are you going to offer me anything real?” “This
        debate is tiresome.” “BORING!”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unless the NPC is deceitful, it should be clear to the
      heroes if their argument helped convince the NPC, if they
      need to take a new approach, or if the argument actually did
      more harm than good.</p>
      <p>The initial response should come with an offer (or a
      refusal to make an offer) based on the NPC's current
      interest. If a hero's argument reduces an NPC's patience to
      0, the NPC lets the heroes know that this is their final
      offer.</p>

        <h4>FOR THE DIRECTOR: REASONS FOR DECEPTION</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Under certain circumstances, an NPC might not want to
          show the heroes how well their arguments are working. For
          example, if an NPC's interest has dropped so low that
          they now intend to harm the heroes, the NPC might falsely
          agree to what the heroes ask for as part of a trap.
          Likewise, a greedy NPC might try to keep their enthusiasm
          for a deal concealed while their interest is high to
          obtain more money or favors from the heroes. If a hero
          thinks an NPC is attempting to fool them, they can make
          an Intuition test. On a success, the hero learns their

        the deal, the NPC might waive those obligations, allowing
        the heroes to get what they want for free. Alternatively,
        the NPC might hold the heroes to any offers they made and
        instead offer an extra service or item on top of what was
        asked for.</p>
        <p>For example, if the heroes asked the boss of a thieves
        guild for that organization's help in standing against Lord
        Saxton, the guildmaster might pledge to send a unit of
        elite assassins to aid in the battle against that
        tyrannical noble, and then offer the heroes a quiver filled
        with explosive arrows to give them an additional advantage
        in the fight.</p>
        <p>The NPC should let the heroes know that this is the best
        offer they can make.</p>

        <h4>INTEREST 4 (“YES.”)</h4>
        <p>If the NPC's interest is 4, they offer the heroes
        everything they asked for but won't sweeten the deal. The
        NPC also accepts anything the heroes have offered as part
        of the deal with this result.</p>
        <p>For example, if the heroes offered to help spring a
        guild thief from prison in exchange for the thieves guild's
        elite assassins standing against Lord Saxton, the
        guildmaster agrees to those terms without attempting to
        adjust anything. This likely ends the negotiation, but it's
        possible that the heroes could push for a little more,
        provided the NPC has the patience for another argument. A
        Director could prompt the heroes to push for more by having
        the NPC ask a leading question, such as, “Is there anything
        else?” or “What else do you want from me?”</p>

        <h4>INTEREST 3 (“YES, BUT …”)</h4>
        <p>If the NPC's interest is 3, they offer the heroes what
        they want in exchange for everything the heroes offered …
        then they ask for a little extra, such as a favor or a
        payment from the characters. If the heroes offered to free
        a thieves guild member from prison in exchange for the
        service of the organization's assassins, the guildmaster
        might ask them to free an additional prisoner, or to grant
        the prisoner they rescue a sum of cash or a magic
        weapon.</p>

      <section id="interest-2-no-but" class="level4">
        <h4>INTEREST 2 (“NO, BUT …”)</h4>
        <p>If the NPC's interest is 2, the NPC can't give the
        heroes what they want. However, they are willing to offer
        other less impactful goods or services in exchange for
        whatever the heroes have promised. The guildmaster might
        not be willing to spare any troops to fight Lord Saxton,
        but could instead offer the latest spy reports on Saxton's
        movements in exchange for the jailbreak.</p>

      <section id="interest-1-no." class="level4">
        <h4>INTEREST 1 (“NO.”)</h4>
        <p>If the NPC's interest is 1, they outright reject the
        heroes' idea without a counteroffer. If the NPC still has
        patience, they might press the heroes for a better deal,
        saying something like, “Why should we risk our necks to
        help you fight Lord Saxton? What's really in it for the
        thieves guild, other than a short, brutal end when you
        inevitably fail?”</p>

      <section id="interest-0-no-and" class="level4">
        <h4>INTEREST 0 (“NO, AND …”)</h4>
        <p>If an NPC's interest is 0, they offer nothing, refuse to
        negotiate further, and seek to harm the heroes. The NPC
        might attack immediately, or they could take a different
        approach, perhaps spreading malicious rumors about the
        characters, sending assassins after them, or otherwise
        making their lives difficult. If the heroes don't want to
        be at odds with the NPC, they'll need to offer an valuable
        gift or undertake a quest just to make amends.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to continue a negotiation when an NPC's

        <h4>FOR THE DIRECTOR: CREATING RESPONSES AND OFFERS</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>When you're preparing a negotiation, think of at least
          two specific asks that the NPC could make of the heroes.
          Then you're prepared if the heroes ask what they can do
          for the NPC and you want to give a response, or if the
          NPC's interest becomes 3.</p>
          <p>These asks could be specific items the heroes have or
          can obtain (such as a magic sword or psionic crystal), or
          they might be favors in the form of adventuring (such as
          slaying a dragon or rescuing a village from a siege).</p>
          <p>You should also have at least two specific ways the
          NPC can help the heroes beyond what they're asking for.
          These can be used if the NPC's interest becomes 2, to
          give the heroes something that can help them that isn't
          what they asked for. They can also be used if the NPC's
          interest rises to 5, to give the heroes something extra
          in addition to what they asked for. This help could take
          the form of treasures or the assistance of a companion or
          retainer. It might be hidden information that the heroes
          don't yet know, and which can help them with their
          overall goal. Or perhaps it's a less impactful version of
          what the heroes initially asked for. If the heroes ask an
          ancient dragon for help storming a castle, the dragon
          might offer the services of their younger, less powerful
          offspring instead of their own assistance … or in
          addition to it!</p>

      <h3>KEEP GOING OR STOP</h3>
      <p>If an NPC still has patience after making an offer and
      their interest is between 1 and 4, the heroes can make
      another argument to attempt to improve the deal.
      Alternatively, they can accept the offer and end the
      negotiation. Let the players drive this decision. You can
      always have an NPC show they have patience remaining by
      asking, “Is there anything else?”</p>
      <p>If the NPC's patience is 0 or their interest is 5, then

      <h3>SAMPLE NEGOTIATION</h3>
      <p>After killing the true lord of Bedegar, the tyrannical
      Lord Saxton took over the barony's capital, and is presently
      gathering forces of his own to march on the rest of Bedegar's
      settlements. The heroes recently saved Edmund, the true heir
      to Bedegar's throne, and are now gathering forces to build an
      army that can stand against Saxton and defeat the tyrant.</p>
      <p>The heroes are engaging in a negotiation with Zola
      Honeycut, the human guildmaster of the Clock—a thieves' guild
      whose headquarters is located in Bedegar's capital. The guild
      openly opposed Saxton when he first seized power, but the
      tyrant was quick to crack down on all known members of the
      Clock, forcing them into hiding or hanging them as a warning
      to others. The heroes' hope is that they can convince Zola to
      support their armed resistance.</p>
      <section id="zolas-negotiation-stats" class="level4">
        <h4>ZOLA'S NEGOTIATION STATS</h4>
        <p>Zola is neutral toward the heroes when the negotiation
        begins. She knows them only by reputation, though she
        understands that they too believe Saxton is a tyrant who
        must be stopped. However, standing up to that tyrant has
        cost her people dearly, and she's not sure she's ready to
        rejoin the fight. One wrong move could spell the end of the
        Clock!</p>
        <p><strong>ZOLA HONEYCUT NEGOTIATION STATS:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Interest:</strong> 2</li>
          <li><strong>Patience:</strong> 3</li>
          <li><strong>Impression:</strong> 3</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Motivations</strong> -
        <strong>Benevolence:</strong> Zola's name, Honeycut, comes
        from the fact that she always gives her fellow thieves a
        bigger cut than her own on jobs. -
        <strong>Protection:</strong> The members of the Clock are
        the only family Zola's ever known. The guild's motto is
        “The Clock is always ticking,” because they're always
        planning the next job and their ever-richer future. Zola
        doesn't want to be the guild's last master.</p>
        <p><strong>Pitfalls</strong> - <strong>Higher
        Authority:</strong> Zola has no interest in serving anyone
        other than herself, and she scoffs at the suggestion of
        taking orders. - <strong>Revelry:</strong> Zola is all
        business and has no time for frivolity, especially while
        living under Saxton's threat.</p>

        <h4>ROLEPLAYING ZOLA</h4>
        <p>Zola is glad that people are finally opposing Lord
        Saxton, but is angry that no one rose up with the Clock
        months ago when the tyrant first staged his coup. She's
        passionate about protecting her people, quick to call out
        dangerous plans in arguments she doesn't like, and fast to
        praise statements she agrees with. She's not afraid to
        speak her mind to the heroes, knowing that they share her
        desire to see Saxton gone. She's just not sure she can risk
        more of her found family in the current fight.</p>

      <section id="negotiation-in-action" class="level4">
        <h4>NEGOTIATION IN ACTION</h4>
        <p>Here's how the negotiation with Zola might play out. In
        this scenario, Alyssa is playing Jorn the tactician, Grace
        is playing Val the conduit, James is playing Korvo the
        shadow, and Matt is playing Linn the talent. All the heroes
        have a Renown of 2 except for Jorn, who has a Renown of 3
        and is therefore famous to Zola.</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> The windows are boarded up,
        allowing no light to enter the seemingly abandoned Goat's
        Eye tavern. The whole place smells of charred wood,
        evidence of the fire that burned most of the building's
        interior three years ago. As the door shuts behind you,
        light from a hooded lantern on the opposite side of the
        tavern suddenly fills the room. Amid the blackened walls
        and pillars, you see that six burly ruffians flank your
        group on both sides. The human holding the lantern smiles.
        “Welcome. I'm Zola. Willoughby told me you were coming.
        Have a seat.” She motions to a few crates arranged in a
        circle around a wide barrel.</p>
        <p><strong>James (playing Korvo):</strong> I have a seat
        and say, “Korvo at your service, Ms. Honeycut. And
        these here are the finest companions a polder could ask
        for: Linn, Jorn, and Val.”</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> Zola nods to each of you in
        turn, then says, “You'll excuse me if I dispense with more
        pleasantries. These days, no place is safe for the Clock.
        We keep moving. So tell me, what are you here for?”</p>
        <p><strong>Alyssa (playing Jorn):</strong> “We're building
        an army to take down Saxton once and for all.”</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> Zola gives a mirthless
        chuckle as she shakes her head. “Oh is that all? I have to
        tell you, I don't think the four of you stand much of a
        chance. Unless you're hiding a legion or two of dwarves in
        your pockets. Yes, you have Jorn the Mighty with you, but
        you'll need more than one famous warrior to win the
        day.”</p>
        <p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> Ah! So she has heard of me at
        least! Thanks, Renown.</p>
        <p><strong>Grace (playing Val):</strong> “We don't. But we
        do have Lord Edmund—the true heir to the Bedegar
        throne.”</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> Zola nods, impressed. “I'm
        glad the boy is safe, but that's all he is—a boy, not an
        army.”</p>
        <p><strong>Matt (playing Linn):</strong> “He's a boy people
        will rally around. We have no army, but that's why we're
        here. We're planning on changing that. Can you spare any
        soldiers for our cause?”</p>
        <p>The negotiation officially starts. The heroes have
        stated what they want from Zola. The Director begins by
        prompting them to make an argument.</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> Zola leans back on her crate.
        “There it is. The Clock has sacrificed much against Saxton.
        Why should we risk more to help? No one was here to help us
        months ago when we stood up to tyranny.”</p>
        <p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> I nod along as Zola speaks,
        listening before I say, “We didn't hear of your struggle
        until after Saxton had already hanged many of your brave
        people. We're here now. How can we help?”</p>
        <p>Before making an argument, Jorn is attempting to learn
        what Zola's motivations are by simply asking. The Director
        decides to reveal one of Zola's motivations:
        protection.</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> “If I were to make a deal
        with you, and that's a big ‘if,' I'd need assurances that
        you can end this. Proof would be even better. The
        protection of my people is my top priority. We can earn
        freedom from Saxton once we regain our strength.”</p>
        <p><strong>James:</strong> Aha! I got this, folks. I stand
        atop my crate and say, “Well, we can surely offer that,
        Ms. Honeycut. We have convinced Lord Edmund to grant
        amnesty to any who swear to serve him.” I'd like to roll a
        Presence test to convince her.</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> Hold it there, champ. Zola's
        eyes narrow as you speak, and she holds up a hand to cut
        you off. “I will not swear to serve any ruler, no matter
        how benevolent. I'll consider being a partner, but even
        that outlook is grim if you tell me again that I need to
        bend the knee.”</p>
        <p>Korvo inadvertently made an argument using a pitfall by
        appealing to a higher authority. The Director notes that
        Zola's interest drops to 1 and her patience drops to 2.
        Zola gave a pretty firm “No” response here, which is what
        an NPC with an interest of 1 would say. However, the
        Director phrased Zola's response in such a way that the
        heroes know they can keep making arguments if they wish,
        since her patience hasn't run out.</p>
        <p><strong>James:</strong> Sorry! I thought that'd work.
        Seems like higher authority is a pitfall for her.</p>
        <p><strong>Grace:</strong> Let's try to avoid any others.
        Val says, “We're sorry, Zola. We don't want to do anything
        else to offend you.” I'd like to make an Intuition test and
        use my Read Person skill to gauge her reaction to see if I
        can discern any other pitfalls.</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> Cool. Hard difficulty.</p>
        <p><strong>Grace:</strong> I got a 17! Success.</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> Zola sits back, chuckling.
        “There's two things I can't stand—anyone telling me to kiss
        a ring and merry fools who would rather go drinking than
        fight for their freedom. Luckily, you're not the latter.”
        You can tell that revelry also won't go over well with
        Zola.</p>
        <p>The heroes now know both of Zola's pitfalls: higher
        authority and revelry.</p>
        <p><strong>Linn:</strong> Linn is going to say, “We're
        recruiting more than just the Clock. We have a good chance
        of recruiting the elves of the wode and the orcs of Forest
        Rend, and we're already training the people of Gravesford
        to put up a fight. If we strike before Saxton can fully
        build his forces, we all stand a better chance of survival.
        If you don't stand with us, Saxton will still come for you.
        He's already coming for you. The Clock stands less of a
        chance alone.”</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> I think that's a Reason test,
        since you're using logic to point out that you have a
        better chance together than on your own. It's easy too,
        since you're appealing to one of her motivations.</p>
        <p><strong>Linn:</strong> Great! Can I use Lead here, since
        I'm demonstrating our ability to bring people together?</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> I'll allow it.</p>
        <p><strong>Linn:</strong> That's a 14!</p>
        <p>Because Linn appealed to a motivation, Zola's interest
        increases to 2, and her patience remains at 2. The Director
        gives a “No, but …” response based on Zola's interest. At
        this point, the heroes haven't promised anything, so she
        offers them something for free. The Director makes it clear
        in Zola's response that the negotiation can still continue
        if that's what the players want.</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> Zola nods along as you speak.
        “You're correct, but I'm not sure I can spare the people.
        I'll tell you what I can do. I have spies watching Saxton
        still. I can give you information about his troops'
        movements. Will that suffice?”</p>
        <p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> I don't think so, right?</p>
        <p><strong>James:</strong> No. We need an army.</p>
        <p><strong>Matt:</strong> Yeah, let's push it.</p>
        <p><strong>Grace:</strong> Agreed.</p>
        <p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> I wonder if we can try to
        figure out another one of her motivations.</p>
        <p><strong>James:</strong> Is there anything I know about
        Zola's reputation? I have the Criminal Underworld
        skill.</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> Make a hard Reason test.</p>
        <p><strong>James:</strong> That's an 18! Success!</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> Korvo would know that Zola
        got the name Honeycut because she's generous with the
        guild's earnings. She gives all her fellow thieves a nice
        cut of every job.</p>
        <p>Korvo's success has revealed Zola's benevolence
        motivation.</p>
        <p><strong>James:</strong> Brilliant! I think I probably
        would've shared that with the group before this.</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> Yeah, that makes sense.</p>
        <p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> Great. I'll say, “It would be
        worthwhile in other ways for your crew if you joined our
        side.”</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> Zola's interest is piqued.
        “What makes you say that?”</p>
        <p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> “Even before his coup, Saxton
        had a considerable amount of wealth. If he's deposed, those
        riches need to go somewhere. The Clock will get a cut—a
        honey of a cut, you might say. Edmund has also promised to
        share his family's fortune with any who stand with him
        against Saxton … after the young lord reclaims the throne,
        that is.”</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> You're appealing to one of
        her motivations, so make an easy Presence test.</p>
        <p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> Can I use my Persuade skill
        too?</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> Absolutely. And you gain an
        edge because you're famous to her.</p>
        <p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> I got a 12!</p>
        <p>Because Jorn appealed to a motivation, Zola's interest
        increases to 3, and her patience is reduced to 1. The
        Director gives a “Yes, but …” response while making it
        clear that the negotiation can still continue.</p>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong> Zola contemplates this for a
        moment. She nods, “I'm starting to see the benefits. I
        think I can spare some folks to help you, but you have to
        help them first. See, my best warriors are locked up in
        Bedegar Keep. They're supposed to be hanged in two days. If
        you free them, I'll see to it they stand with you against
        Saxton. We were making a plan to free them ourselves, but
        could frankly use the help.”</p>
        <p><strong>Grace:</strong> We could push the Clock to do it
        themselves, but I can't see Val turning her back on people
        in need.</p>
        <p><strong>James:</strong> Hear, hear. I'm done pushing my
        luck on this one.</p>
        <p><strong>Matt:</strong> It'll mean less time to recruit
        the other troops, so we'd better work quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> Then we're in agreement. I
        offer a handshake to Zola. “You've got yourself a
        deal.”</p>
        <p>The negotiation ends! The heroes could have pushed for a
        better deal, but they're satisfied with the offer from
        Zola, so they accept her terms.</p>
