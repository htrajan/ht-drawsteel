###### Molecular Rearrangement Field (7 Discipline)

*Your enemies' wounds open, your allies' wounds close.*

| **Psionic** | **Maneuver** |
| ----------- | -----------: |
| **📏 Self** |  **🎯 Self** |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter, the size of your Null Field ability increases by 1. While the area of that ability is enlarged this way, each enemy who has I < AVERAGE and enters the area for the first time in a combat round or starts their turn there is bleeding (save ends). Each ally who enters the area for the first time in a combat round or starts their turn there gains temporary Stamina equal to your Intuition score.
