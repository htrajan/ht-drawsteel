#### Harbinger of the Primordial Chaos

You can create a temporary source of elemental power as a respite activity. This source of elemental power lasts 24 hours after creation, and can be used to create a portal to Quintessence with your Primordial Portal feature. If you do so, the source of elemental power lasts as long as the portal is maintained in your network.
