#### Primordial Strike

You can manifest your ferocity directly as an elemental force created by the Primordial Chaos. As part of any strike, you can spend 1 ferocity to gain 1 surge that must be used for that strike. The extra damage dealt by the surge can be acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic (your choice).
