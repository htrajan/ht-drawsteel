#### Grab

A creature seeking to keep a foe close and locked down can attempt to grab a creature using the following ability.

###### Grab

| **Melee, Weapon** |        **Maneuver** |
| ----------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**    | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** No effect.
- **12-16:** You can grab the target, but if you do, the target can make a melee free strike against you before they are grabbed.
- **17+:** The target is grabbed by you.

**Effect:** You can usually target only creatures of your size or smaller. If your Might score is 2 or higher, you can target any creature with a size equal to or less than your Might score.

Unless otherwise indicated, a creature can grab only one creature at a time.

See [Conditions](#page-91-2) in [Chapter 5: Classes](#page-83-2) for information on the grabbed condition.
