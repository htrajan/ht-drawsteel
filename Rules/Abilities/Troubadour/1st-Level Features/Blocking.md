###### Blocking

*No, no, no, you lose the audience that way. Try it like this...*

| **Area, Magic, Performance** |                    **No action** |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------: |
| **📏 2 aura**                | **🎯 Each creature in the area** |

**Effect:** At the end of each of your turns while this performance is active, you can choose up to a number of targets equal to your Presence score and teleport those targets to unoccupied spaces in the area. A target can't be teleported in a way that would harm them (such as over a cliff), leave them dying, or result in them suffering a condition or other negative effect.
