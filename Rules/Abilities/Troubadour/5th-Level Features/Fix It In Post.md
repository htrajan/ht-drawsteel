###### Fix It in Post

Once on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to change one condition affecting a creature within distance of your Dramatic Monologue ability. Choose one of the following conditions on the target: bleeding, frightened, prone, slowed, or taunted. You change that condition to another of those conditions, maintaining the duration and origin of the original condition. A target who is no longer prone can stand up.
