###### Counterstrategy (11 Focus)

*I've identified a way to negate their strengths.*

| **-**       | **Main action** |
| ----------- | --------------: |
| **📏 Self** |     **🎯 Self** |

**Effect:** You gain 6 surges. Until the end of the encounter or until you are dying, whenever the Director spends Malice (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*), choose yourself or one ally within 10 squares. The chosen character gains 2 of their Heroic Resource.
