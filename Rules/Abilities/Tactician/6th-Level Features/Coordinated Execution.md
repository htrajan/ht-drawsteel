###### Coordinated Execution (9 Focus)

*You direct your ally to make a killing blow.*

| **Ranged**       | **Free triggered** |
| ---------------- | -----------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10** |    **🎯 One ally** |

**Trigger:** The target uses an ability to deal rolled damage to a creature while hidden.

**Effect:** If the target of the triggering ability is not a leader or solo creature, they are reduced to 0 Stamina. If the target of the triggering ability is a minion, the entire squad is killed. If the target of the triggering ability is a leader or solo creature, the triggering ability's power roll automatically obtains a tier 3 outcome.
