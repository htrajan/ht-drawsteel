###### You've Still Got Something Left (9 Focus)

*You push an ally to use a heroic ability sooner than they otherwise would.*

| **Ranged**       | **Main action** |
| ---------------- | --------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 One ally** |

**Effect:** The target uses a heroic ability with the Strike keyword as a free triggered action, and deals extra damage with that ability equal to your Reason score. The ability has its Heroic Resource cost reduced by 1 + your Reason score (minimum cost 0).
