##### Bait and Ambush

You have trained your squad to be silent ambushers.

**Mark Benefit:** When you or any ally makes a strike against a creature marked by you, you can spend 2 focus to let the character making the strike shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score and use the Hide maneuver as a free maneuver once during the shift. The creature can shift before or after the strike is resolved.
