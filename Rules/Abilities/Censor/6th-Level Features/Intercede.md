###### Intercede (9 Wrath)

*You take your ally's place.*

| **Magic, Ranged** | **Free triggered** |
| ----------------- | -----------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**  |    **🎯 One ally** |

**Trigger:** A creature makes a strike against the target.

**Effect:** The target is unaffected by the strike and you become the target instead, even if you aren't a valid target for it. You take half the damage from the strike, and the target gains 3 surges.
