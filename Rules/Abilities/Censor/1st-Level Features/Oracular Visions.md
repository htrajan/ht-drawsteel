##### Oracular Visions

Your deity rewards you with hazy visions of things to come. Each time you earn 1 or more Victories, you earn an equal number of fate points. Whenever you or a creature within 10 squares makes a test, you can spend 1 fate point to tap into a vision of the outcome, granting that creature an edge on the test. You lose any remaining fate points when you finish a respite.
