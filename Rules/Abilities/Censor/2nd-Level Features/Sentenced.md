###### Sentenced (5 Wrath)

*The shock of your condemnation freezes your enemy in their boots.*

| **Magic, Melee, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**                   | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** 5 + P damage; P < WEAK, restrained (save ends)
- **12-16:** 9 + P damage; P < AVERAGE, restrained (save ends)
- **17+:** 12 + P damage; P < STRONG, restrained (save ends)

**Effect:** While the target is restrained this way, your abilities that impose forced movement can still move them.
