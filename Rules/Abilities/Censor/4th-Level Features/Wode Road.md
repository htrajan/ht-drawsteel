##### Wode Road

As a main action, you touch a living tree and make it part of a divine transportation network. You can maintain a number of trees in your network equal to your Presence score. Whenever you touch any tree in your network, you can use a main action to teleport yourself and any willing creatures within 10 squares of you to a tree in your network on the same world. If a tree in your network dies, it is no longer part of the network. You can remove a tree from your network no matter your distance from it, including across different worlds (no action required).
