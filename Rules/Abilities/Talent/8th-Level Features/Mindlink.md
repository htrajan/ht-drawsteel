##### Mindlink

During a respite, you can choose a number of creatures up to your Reason score who you have communicated with using your Telepathic Speech feature, creating a telepathic link among all of you. Whenever a linked creature spends one or more Recoveries, each other linked creature can spend a Recovery.
