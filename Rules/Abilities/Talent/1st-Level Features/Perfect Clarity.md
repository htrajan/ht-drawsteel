###### Perfect Clarity (5 Clarity)

*You clear the mind of nothing but the goal.*

| **Psionic, Ranged, Telepathy** |            **Maneuver** |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**               | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** Until the start of your next turn, the target gains a +3 bonus to speed, and they have a double edge on the next power roll they make. If the target obtains a tier 3 outcome on that roll, you gain 1 clarity.

**Strained:** You take 1d6 damage, and you can't use triggered actions (save ends).
