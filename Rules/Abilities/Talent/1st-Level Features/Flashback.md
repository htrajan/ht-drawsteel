###### Flashback (5 Clarity)

*The target is thrown several seconds back through time and gets to do it all again.*

| **Chronopathy, Psionic, Ranged** |            **Maneuver** |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                 | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** The target uses an ability with a base Heroic Resource cost of 7 or lower that they've previously used this round, without needing to spend the base cost. Augmentations to the ability can be paid for as usual.

**Strained:** You take 1d6 damage and are slowed (save ends).
