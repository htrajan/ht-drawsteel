###### Repel

*They aren't going anywhere, but you might!*

| **Psionic, Ranged** |           **Triggered** |
| ------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**    | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Trigger:** The target takes damage or is force moved.

**Effect:** The target takes half the triggering damage, or the distance of the triggering forced movement is reduced by a number of squares equal to your Reason score. If the target took damage and was force moved, you choose the effect. If the forced movement is reduced to 0 squares, the target can push the source of the forced movement a number of squares equal to your Reason score.
