##### Ward of Nature's Affection

The green energy writhing within your body allows you to produce powerful vines when you're in danger. Whenever a creature within a number of squares equal to your Reason score deals damage to you, you can use a free triggered action to slide that creature up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score.
