###### Subtle Relocation

*You call on the void to swallow and spit out an ally.*

| **Magic, Ranged, Void** |           **Triggered** |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**        | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Trigger:** The target starts their turn, moves, or is force moved.

**Effect:** You teleport the target up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score. If the target moves to trigger this ability, you can teleport them at any point during the move.

**Spend 1 Essence:** You teleport the target up to a number of squares equal to twice your Reason score instead.
