##### It Is the Soul Which Hears

You can speak with and understand animals, beasts, and plant creatures, even if they don't share a language with you. Your ability to communicate with these creatures doesn't make them inherently more intelligent, but you can use Reason instead of Presence while making tests to influence them.

Additionally, you can touch a living plant that is not a plant creature to communicate with it telepathically. You can use words to communicate with the plant, but it communicates with you only by transmitting feelings and sensations that can't be overly specific.
