###### Tide of Death (3 Ferocity)

*Teach them the folly of lining up for you.*

| **Melee, Weapon**      | **Main action** |
| ---------------------- | --------------: |
| **📏 Self; see below** |     **🎯 Self** |

**Effect:** You move up to your speed in a straight line, and enemy squares are not difficult terrain for this movement. You can end this movement in a creature's space and move them to an adjacent unoccupied space. You make one power roll that targets each enemy whose space you move through.

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** 2 damage
- **12-16:** 3 damage
- **17+:** 5 damage

**Effect:** The last target you damage takes extra damage equal to your Might score for each opportunity attack you trigger during your move.
