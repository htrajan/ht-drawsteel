###### Blessing of Secrets

*You project an illusory aura that makes you and allies harder to notice.*

| **Magic**     |                          **Maneuver** |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------: |
| **📏 3 aura** | **🎯 Self and each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** Each creature in the area has a double edge on tests made to hide or sneak. The aura lasts until you end it (no action required) or until a target harms or deals damage to a creature or object.
