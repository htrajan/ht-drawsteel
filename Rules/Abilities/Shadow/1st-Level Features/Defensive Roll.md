###### Defensive Roll

*When an enemy attacks, you roll with the impact to reduce the harm.*

| **—**       | **Triggered** |
| ----------- | ------------: |
| **📏 Self** |   **🎯 Self** |

**Trigger:** Another creature damages you.

**Effect:** You take half the triggering damage, then can shift up to 2 squares after the triggering effect resolves. If you end this shift with concealment or cover, you can use the Hide maneuver even if you are observed.

**Spend 1 Insight:** The potency of any effects associated with the damage are reduced by 1 for you.
