###### Puppet Strings (9 Insight)

*You prick little needles on the tips of your fingers into the nerves of your enemies and cause them to lose control.*

| **Magic, Melee**, **Strike, Weapon** |    **Main action** |
| ------------------------------------ | -----------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**                       | **🎯 Two enemies** |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **≤11:** 2 damage; if the target has R < WEAK, before the damage is resolved, they make a free strike.
- **12-16:** 5 damage; if the target has R < AVERAGE, before the damage is resolved, they use a main action ability of your choice.
- **17+:** 7 damage; if the target has R < STRONG, before the damage is resolved, they can shift up to their speed and use a main action ability of your choice.

**Effect:** You choose the new targets for the original target's free strike or ability. Additionally, if you are hidden or disguised, using this ability doesn't cause you to be revealed.
