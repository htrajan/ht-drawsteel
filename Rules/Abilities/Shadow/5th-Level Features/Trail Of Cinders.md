##### Trail of Cinders

Whenever you reduce a non-minion creature to 0 Stamina, you can immediately use a free maneuver to use your Black Ash Teleport ability.

Additionally, you can now bring an adjacent willing creature along with you whenever you use a shadow ability to teleport. The creature appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the space into which you teleported. If no such space exists, they can't teleport with you.
