# Defensive Roll

When an enemy attacks, you roll with the impact to reduce the harm.

| **Keywords:** —    | **Type:** Triggered |
| **Distance:** Self | **Target:** Self    |

**Trigger:** Another creature damages you.

**Effect:** You gain (SHIELD) against the triggering damage and then can shift up to 2 squares after the damage and its effects resolve. If you end this movement with concealment or cover, you can use the Hide maneuver even if you are observed.

**Spend 1 Insight:** You gain (SHIELD)(SHIELD) against the triggering damage instead.
