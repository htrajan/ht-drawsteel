| Keywords: Area              | Type: Villain Action 3      |
| Distance: Self and 10 burst | Target: Self and all allies |

**Effect:** Each target moves up to their speed and makes a free strike. Creatures that take damage from this villain action are also knocked prone.

**Death Rampage**

Whenever an ally within 5 is reduced to 0 Stamina, the last laugh moves up to their speed and either chooses to target 2 creatures with free strikes or one creature with shrapnel whip.

**Running Joke**

If the last laugh is reduced to 0 Stamina while there are still gnolls on the battle map, one gnoll on the map is transformed into the last laugh, keeping the gnoll's Stamina.
