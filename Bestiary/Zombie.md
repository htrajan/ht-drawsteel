**Effect:** A target who starts their turn grabbed by the zombie takes 2 corruption damage. If a creature takes 5 or more corruption damage this way, they become insatiably hungry for flesh. The target must complete the Find a Cure project to end this effect.

**Arise**

The first time the zombie is reduced to Stamina 0 by damage that isn't fire damage or holy damage and their body isn't destroyed, they regain half their Stamina and fall prone.

**Endless Knight**

The zombie can take advantage of their Arise trait twice.
