# Draw Steel Bestiary

## CREATURE STATS

Most of the information presented in a creature’s stat block is self-explanatory, and matches the statistics of
hero player characters. However, a few differences are worth noting.
_(Playtest note: Right now, creatures are color coded, but this won’t be the only way we indicate different
features.Icons are coming too. What are presented in this packet are temporary playtest stat blocks until we get real
layout.)_

> FOR THE DIRECTOR The information in this Bestiary playtest packet is for the Director, and all references to> “you” in
> the packet refer to the director. If you’re a player who isn’t planning on also running games, you should> stop>
> reading
> now so your foes’ abilities remain a surprise .

### LANGUAGES

If a creature knows at least one language, their stat block has a Languages entry that shows the languages they
know.Creatures who don’t know any languages don’t have this entry.

### KEYWORDS

Each creature has one or more keywords. These keywords don’t necessarily mean anything on their own, but special
rulesmight apply to them. For instance, a creature with the Goblin keyword benefits from and can contribute to goblin
VillainPower abilities (see below).

### ENCOUNTER VALUE

Each Director-controlled creature has an encounter value (abbreviated EV) that is used in building encounters.
SeeEncounter Building for more information.

### CREATURE FREE STRIKES

When a Director-controlled creature makes a free strike,they don’t roll. Instead, their stat block features a Free
Strike stat representing the amount of damage they deal with a melee free strike with a distance of reach 1 or the
creature’s signature action, whichever is higher. This is also the amount of damage they deal with a ranged free strike
with a distance equal to 5 or the range of the creature’s signature action, whichever is higher. Unless otherwise noted,
a free strike in a trait is a weapon attack.
Creature free strikes are a static number for two reasons. First, it keeps gameplay fast.You don’t have to stop play to
roll dice, and there’s no chance of a creature rolling a critical hit and bogging things down further when it isn’t
their
turn. Second, by keeping these static values relatively low, heroes are encouraged to take more risks when it really
counts, even if that might result in them taking damage from a free strike.

#### CREATURE OPPORTUNITY ATTACKS

Even though a Director-controlled creature doesn’t have to roll when they make a free strike, if they have a bane
onattacks against a creature, they still can’t make an opportunity attack against them.

### SIGNATURE ACTION

Every creature has a signature action, which is the first action that appears in their stat block.

### TRAITS

Many creatures have traits, which are features that don’t require an action, maneuver, or triggered action to
activate,such as the goblin monarch’s Crafty trait.

### VILLAIN POWER ABILITIES

Many creatures have abilities that require Villain Power (abbreviated VP) to activate. See Villain Power for
moreinformation.

### END EFFECT

Certain creatures have the ability to take damage in order to end one EoE (end of encounter) effect currently
affectingthem. The damage the creature takes to end the effect can’t be reduced in any way.

### VILLAIN ACTIONS

The solo and boss creatures presented in this book are designed to be fought in climactic battles at the end of
an adventure or campaign. Because of this, they get special abilities called villain actions.

A creature with villain actions always has three. Each villain action can be used only once per encounter, and no
more than one villain action can be used per round. A creature can use a villain action at the end of any other
creature’s turn during combat. Villain actions are numbered and intended to be used in a specific order that creates a
logicalencounter flow and cinematic arc, but you can use them in any order you choose.

The first villain action is an opener, which shows the heroes they’re not battling a typical creature. Openers
generally deal some damage, summon a lackey or three, buff the boss, debuff the heroes, or move the creature into an
advantageous position. They’re a taste of what’s to come.

The second villain action provides crowd control. It typically activates after the heroes have had a chance to
respond once or twice to the villain, move into position, and surround the villain. This second action helps the villain
regain the upper hand. Like an opener, this action comes in many flavors, but it’s even more powerful than an opener.

The third and final villain action is an ultimate move or “ult”—a showstopper that the villain can use to deal
a devastating blow to the heroes before the end of the battle. If you have more than two creatures with villain actions
in an encounter (which should be a rare, if at all occurrence), only one villain action total may be used per round.

### RESISTANCE ROLL ABILITIES

Some creature abilities say “\[Characteristic Abbreviation\] RR” instead of providing a dice equation. This means
that instead of the creature rolling when the ability is used, the target of the ability must make a resistance roll
with
the indicated characteristic against the ability’s effects.

### CREATURE ROLES

A creature’s role describes its function in combat in a general sense. Roles are descriptive, and most don’t
follow special rules—they simply help you build encounters and use creatures effectively in combat. _(Playtest note: A
lot more guidance for using roles in building encounters is coming.)_

#### AMBUSHER

Ambushers are melee warriors who can slip by beefier heroes to reach squishier targets in the back lines.

#### ARTILLERY

Artillery creatures fight best from afar, and can use their most powerful abilities at great distance.

#### BOSS

Boss creatures are powerful commanders who often serve as villains at the climax of adventures and campaigns. They
have better Stamina and damage output than other creatures, and often aid those creatures—or can sacrifice lesser allies
for their own benefit.

#### BRUTE

Brutes are hardy creatures who have lots of Stamina and deal lots of damage. They have abilities and traits that
make them difficult to ignore and hard to get away from, and that let them push enemies around.

#### CONTROLLER

Controllers are creatures who change the battlefield, often with magic or psionics. They reposition foes and
alter terrain to make it more advantageous for their allies. Controllers are often on the squishier side, so they need
some protection!

#### DEFENDER

Defenders are tough creatures able to take a lot of damage, and who can force enemies to attack them instead of
squishier
targets. Defenders often act in squads with allies who have lower Stamina, such as controllers and hexers.

#### HARRIER

Harriers are mobile warriors who make definitive use of hit-and-run tactics. Their traits allow them to makethe most of
their positioning on the battlefield.

#### HEXER

Hexers specialize in debuffing enemies with conditions and other effects. They are generally squishy and rely on allies
to help defend them.

#### MOUNT

Mounts are mobile creatures meant to be ridden in combat , and who make their riders even more dangerous. Mounts act
atthe same time as their riders.

#### SOLO

A solo creature is an action-oriented creature capable of tak ing on the player characters on their own, or with
thebackup of just a handful of underlings.  _(Playtest note: There are no solo creatures in this packet.)_

#### SUPPORT

Support creatures specialize in aiding their allies, providing buffs, healing, movement, or action options.

## CREATURES WHO GRAB

If a creature has an ability or trait that allows them to grab another creature, they can have only one creature
grabbed at a time unless their stat block specifies otherwise. If the creature has already grabbed the maximum number
of creatures, the ability or trait used to grab can’t be used against another target unless the creature releases
an already grabbed target.

## MINIONS

Minions are weaker enemies who are made to die fast and to be threatening in large squads. Minion is a monster role
that always has another role such as artillery or brute attached to it, so you know what the minion does well in
addition
to being a minion.
The knowledge of how minions work isn’t a secret, and shouldn’t be kept from the players. Share the information in this
section with them! They’ll have a lot more fun battling minions and shaping narrative around taking out multiple foes at
once if they understand how the rules work.

### ORGANIZED AS SQUADS

Minions with the same name (for instance, “goblin sniper”) can be organized into squads. All members of a minion squad
act together on the same initiative, and can make squad attacks (see Squad Action).

### SHARED LOW STAMINA

Minions have low Stamina and fall quickly in battle. They allow heroes to feel extra heroic, since a hero might kill
several minions at once, depending on those minions’ level and encounter value!

Each squad of minions shares a Stamina
pool, with initial Stamina equal to each individual minion’s Stamina multiplied by the number of minions in the squad.
For example, goblin snipers each have Stamina 5, so a squad of four snipers has a Stamina pool of 20. Whenever a minion
in a squad takes damage, the squad’s Stamina pool is reduced by a number equal to the damage taken.

Because minion Stamina is tracked as a pool, minions can’t be winded and can’t regain Stamina during a battle.

#### DROPPING ONE MINION

Whenever a minion squad’s Stamina pool is reduced by an amount equal to an individual minion’s Stamina, one minion
dies or otherwise gets taken out of the fight. If a squad of goblin snipers has its Stamina pool reduced to 15, then
the minion who took the damage that reduced the pool dies. When the Stamina pool hits 10, 5, and finally 0, another
minion in the squad dies. If multiple minions take the damage that results
in the pool dropping low enough to kill one minion, the creature who dealt the damage to the minions decides which
of those minions dies.

#### DROPPING MULTIPLE MINIONS

If a single attack reduces a minion squad’s Stamina pool by an amount
of damage equal to the Stamina of multiple minions, multiple minions are taken out by the damage. Start with minions
who took the damage first. If all those minions are eliminated and there is still more damage to account for , the
minions nearest to the ones who were taken out suffer the same fate. For instance, if one goblin sniper takes 12 damage
from a fury’s Brutal Slam ability, that sniper dies and another nearby sniper also gets taken out. Allow the player to
narrate how their hero takes out additional minions killed by a single attack. Maybe each minion is within striking
distance of the hero, who makes multiple brutal weapon attacks with a single action. Maybe the body of the original
target is hurled into an unfortunate ally. Maybe additional minions affected by a single attack pass out from fright!
Taking out multiple minions is a chance to play up the cinematic part of the game.

#### DAMAGING MULTIPLE MINIONS

Minion squads are particularly susceptible to damage dealing area abilities and attacks that target multiple creatures,
because
the minion squad’sStamina pool takes damage each time an individual minion takes damage. If three goblin minions are hit
with a conduit’s Lightfall ability that deals 4 holy damage to each target in its area, the minion pool loses 12
Stamina!

#### PREPPING MINION STAMINA POOLS

When you’re preparing a battle with minions, it helps to take a moment and write out the
different amounts of damage at which a minion squad suffers a loss of one of their minions. For instance, a squad of
goblin snipers loses a minion when they take a total of 5, 10, 15, and 20 damage. If you do the math before combat
starts (or take a quick moment to jot it down during a pause in combat), it’ll help things run smoothly.

### DIFFERENT MINION STRENGTHS

Some minions are stronger than others . This lets you create squads of differing numbers of minions to keep the heroes
on
their toes as you build encounters that fit your needs. Some minions attack and die in droves, such as the lowly pitling
demon with Stamina 4. Others might be able to absorb the damage of one or two signature actions before they drop, such
as
the radenwight ratagast with Stamina 12. Both are level 1 minions, but their EVs are different. Fewer ratagasts can and
should be used in a battle as compared to pitlings, and the heroes will need to
use their best abilities to kill several of those more powerful minions at once.

### ACTING TOGETHER

When minions act, each minion in the squad must use their action in concert. This is because minions have squad attacks
that
require participation from all minions, requiring all individual attacks to happen at the same time.

Like all creatures, an individual minion—or all the minions in a squad—can elect to take no action on a turn.

#### MINION ACTION ECONOMY

Minion turns are meant to be short. On their turn, each minion can take only a move action and
an action, a move action and a maneuver, or two move actions.

Minions can make opportunity attacks, but they typically don’t have bespoke triggered actions, keeping them easy to run.

#### SQUAD ACTION

Each minion has a signature action that is an attack ability target ing one creature. When multiple
minions in a squad use their signature action on a turn, make one roll for the whole squad. Each minion must target a
different creature with their signature action. Many minion signature actions benefit from the squad being close
together, so don’t spread them out too far!

If a squad has minions who don’t use their signature action, those minions
can still contribute to the squad’s effectiveness. Each such minion can use an action to increase the damage to one
target of the signature action by an amount equal to the minion’s free strike value, as long as that target is within
distance of the minion as if the minion
were using the action, and the minion has line of effect to the target.

If a minion squad gets a critical hit with their signature action, then all the minions who participated in using
the action can use the action again.

#### TRACKING SQUADS

If you use multiple squads made up of the same type of minions in
an encounter—for instance, two squads of goblin spinecleavers - it’s important to make it easy for the players to tell
the squads apart. You can use different miniatures for each squad, or give each squad’s miniatures an indicator (a
colored magnet, ring, sticker, and so forth) to help you and your players keep track of which minions are part of the
same squad as they start moving around on the battlefield. Many online virtual tabletops have tools for adding colors or
textures to icons that make tracking different squads easy.

### ATTACHED CAPTAIN

Any non-mount creature who speaks a language a squad of minions can understand can be attached to that squad as a
captain. Captains aren’t necessarily
strategic leaders with brilliant strategies. Sometimes they’re just powerful creatures who bully, inspire, or have
some supernatural influence that drives other creatures to action.
A squad of minions can only have one captain, and a creature can’t be captain to more than one squad of minions.

#### SEPARATE ACTIONS AND STAMINA

A captain takes their turn at the same time as the members of their squad but isn’t limited in their action options as
minions are. A captain’s Stamina isn’t added to a minion squad’s Stamina pool and is tracked as for any other creature
in combat.

#### CAPTAIN BENEFITS

While a minion squad has a captain, each minion in the squad gains a +1 bonus to speed. Additionally, the captain gains
an edge on attacks against creatures who are adjacent to one or more of their minions.

#### I AM THE CAPTAIN NOW

If a squad of minions loses their captain, a new allied creature can become that squad’s captain at the start of the
round.

## ENCOUNTER BUILDING

We’re still working on these guidelines, and need to add information about how environment, party composition, and the
like affect encounters. But for this playtest, the basics of encounter building are as follows.

### STEP 1: CHOOSE ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY

First,determine how difficult an encounter you want to create based on the following guidelines.

#### TRIVIAL ENCOUNTERS

Trivial encounters are easier than easy. They present no challenge at all for the heroes, who are guaranteed to survive
the battle with their Stamina mostly, if not entirely, untouched. Think 10th-level heroes taking on a small band of
typical kobolds. There’s no way it ends well for the kobolds. These encounters can be fun to occasionally throw into
your game, but for many groups, the novelty disappears quickly, so that too many trivial encounters can feel like a
waste of time.

Unless you determine otherwise, trivial encounters don’t earn the heroes any Victories.

#### EASY ENCOUNTERS

Unless the heroes have already depleted most of their Stamina and Recoveries, easy encounters won’t threaten their
lives. Easy encounters are great for adventures that want to give the heroes a lot of battles between respites, or for
when you want the heroes to feel like superheroes while still overcoming a combat challenge that feels as though it’s
within their pay grade.

An easy encounter is worth 1 Victory.

#### STANDARD ENCOUNTERS

Standard encounters are the most common for many adventuring groups. These battles deplete some of the heroes’ Stamina
and Recoveries, especially from melee-focused characters. Although character death is uncommon in a standard encounter,
it isn’t impossible, especially if a player makes a poor tactical choice or just finds that the dice are against them.

A standard encounter is worth 1 Victory.

#### HARD ENCOUNTERS

Hard encounters are typically climactic encounters with bosses and their loyal servants, or some other scenario that
puts the heroes' lives in an equal amount of peril. Hard encounters are winnable, but the heroes need to play smart to
survive.

A hard encounter is worth 2 Victories.

#### EXTREME ENCOUNTERS

Extreme encounters feature threats of a level that the heroes aren’t likely to survive if they try to fight to the
bitter end. Such encounters rarely appear in most campaigns, though if the heroes are 8th level or higher, they can
typically survive such encounters - or have a good chance of coming back to life afterward.

If the heroes overcome an extreme encounter, they should be awarded at least 2 Victories.

### STEP 2: DETERMINE ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY

To determine how many creatures and other types of challenges you should have in an encounter, you need to figure out
the heroes’ encounter strength (abbreviated ES).

To calculate a group’s ES, first determine each hero’s encounter worth. This starts at a baseline of 12, then you add 3
for each level of the hero. For instance, a 3rd-level hero has an encounter worth of 21 (12 + 3 + 3 +3). Then add the
encounter worth of all heroes together, and that’s your ES. For instance, a group of five 3rd-level heroes has an ES of

105.

#### FACTOR IN VICTORIES

Victories make heroes more powerful on their way to the next level. For each 3 Victories the heroes earn, increase the
overall ES as if there were another hero in the party. For instance, if a party of 3rd-level heroes has 3 Victories,
increase the ES by 21. If they have 6 Victories, increase the ES by 42. Be careful that the larger ES doesn’t lead you
to using more creatures than recommended in Number of Creatures. It’s usually better to use higher cost creatures in an
encounter rather than add lots when increasing ES thanks to Victories.

Since you can rarely predict the exact order in which the heroes will face encounters during an adventure, it helps to
keep a list of monsters with an EV cost worth roughly the encounter worth of one, two, and three heroes that make sense
for the adventure you’re running. You can easily drop or swap these creatures into an encounter on the fly.

### STEP 3: DETERMINE ENCOUNTER BUDGET

Once you know your ES and have chosen your encounter difficulty, you can determine your encounter budget as follows:

- **Trivial encounters** have a budget that is anything less than 75 percent of your ES.
- **Easy encounters** have a budget of between 75 and 90 percent of your ES.
- **Standard encounters** have a budget that is between 90 and 110 percent of your ES.
- **Hard encounters** have a budget of between 110 and 125 percent of your ES.
- **Extreme encounters** have a budget that is greater than 125 percent of your ES.

### STEP 4: SPEND ENCOUNTER BUDGET

You spend your encounter budget to “buy” hostile creatures to take part in your encounter.Each hostile creature costs a
number of budget points equal to its encounter value (EV). When choosing creatures, try to choose a variety of roles for
a more dynamic combat experience.

#### CONSIDER CREATURE LEVEL

To ensure an encounter is challenging but not devastating for the players, you want to choose creatures whose level
is within 2 of the heroes’ level. For instance, creatures of level 3 through 7 are appropriate challenges for a party
of 5th -level heroes. If the heroes have 6 or more Victories, you can push the upper limit to within 3 levels of
the heroes.

This is really the only indicator that level serves in encounter building. Everything else relies on EV.

#### NUMBER OF CREATURES

Too many creatures or too many different stat blocks in an encounter can create a big cognitive load for you and
turn exciting encounters into slogs.

In general, you don’t want more than five creatures per hero at a time in an encounter.If the encounter has more than
two creatures per hero, at least half the creatures in that encounter should be minions.

When it comes to number of stat blocks, you generally don’t want to use more than six different kinds of stat blocks in
an encounter, though you can probably manage more if you’re using a lot of simple minion stat blocks. If you’re just
starting out as a Director, keep the variety small until you’re confident in your ability to run a complex combat
encounter.

#### STAR OF THE SHOW

Sometimes a combat encounter features a creature that you want to stick around for more than a round of combat and
leave a lasting impression on the heroes. These are typically the named villains who the heroes face in the climax of
an adventure or campaign.

If you want a creature to stick around and leave a lasting impression in a combat encounter, make it a hard encounter
and
choose a boss or solo creature with an EV that is at least half the encounter budget to be the star of the show.

### STEP 5: BUILD INITIATIVE GROUPS

Once you have your creatures selected, you’ll put them together in initiative groups, with all creatures in the same
initiative group acting on the same turn. Though it’s not a hard and fast rule, you can keep the following guideline in
mind as you build initiative groups: The total EV of an initiative group should be between the encounter worth of one to
two heroes (see Step 2 above).

This helps to ensure that each encounter group can hold its own against any character in the party without overwhelming
that character.

It’s okay to have one group with a total EV less than that. It’s also okay for a group to be worth more than two
heroes,as long as that group consists of a single creature or the heroes have racked up a lot of Victories.

#### HOW MANY INITIATIVE GROUPS?

In a battle without a solo creature, you generally want about as many initiative groups as there are heroes plus or
minus two. This gives you a healthy range to play with and makes your turns effective without being overwhelming for the
heroes.

## VILLAIN POWER

Just as every hero has a Heroic Resource determined by their class, so too do the heroes’ foes need their own juice
to fuel their strongest threats. Villain Power (abbreviated VP) is a resource gained by the Director. You use it to
let enemies in the game activate their most powerful abilities and throw surprises at the heroes during combat.

### EARNING VILLAIN POWER

At the start of each round of combat, you gain VP equal to the number of heroes in the battle. If a
hero dies, they stop generating VP for you in this way. At the end of an encounter, all your villain power disappears.

It's up to you if you want to show your players how much VP you have. Some Directors feel the tension of watching VP
creep up and can create great drama, while others like to keep the players guessing about what could come next. Do
whatever is most fun for your group, and if you’re not sure, ask your players what they would prefer!

### SPENDING VILLAIN POWER

Non-minion monsters can spend VP the way heroes spend their heroic resources, activating and enhancing their abilities.
Abilities that make use of Villain Power have that VP cost noted in a creature’s stat block.

Specific types of monsters sometimes have other ways they can spend VP, typically on features that affect an entire
group of enemies or that affect the encounter environment. Such abilities can be found in the “\[Creature\] Villain
Power” section in a creature type’s overall writeup.

You won’t be able to spend your VP on every single option a given encounter has to offer. It’s totally up to you how you
deploy VP. You can spend it on smaller, but still impactful, features each round. You can save it up and use it on some
very dramatic abilities. You can spend it on the same feature that uses all your VP each round and then forget about it
until the next. Do whatever is most fun for you and your players in a given encounter.

## DEMONS

Demons spawn in the Abyssal Wasteland, where evil and chaos meet. These creatures of incarnate evil crave violence and suffering in the way most other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear apart lesser demons for fun.

The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another could have a human arm growing from their forehead.

### MORTAL ALLIANCES

Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.

### SOUL REAVERS

Demons feast not on food or water, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while starved for souls, a demon can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature with a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.

### DEMONIC HIERARCHY

Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, and the higher a demon’s category, the more powerful the fiend. Though demons don’t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service.

Each time a demon consumes a soul, there’s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. Though category 1 demons typically become category 2 demons after consuming a single soul, there’s no known pattern to how more powerful demons evolve. Some category 2 demons evolve to category 3 after consuming just one soul, while others must devour thousands before earning a promotion. The evolution from one category to the next can be instant, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt—or heroic.

*Playtest note: More demon descriptions are coming.*

#### CATEGORY 1 DEMONS

The weakest of demon kind, the following category 1 demons are included in this book:

- **Pitlings** resemble rodents or insects, but possess gleaming green eyes and terrible body odor, and disgorge a viscous, toxic phlegm.
- **Ensnarers** are the result of pitlings getting ahold of an unfortunate soul. The pitling is in the process of digesting the soul of a creature, physically boring through its head, and flopping around like an appendage. The body is puppeteered and mid transformation into a demon, with mouths forming on the creature’s hands and arms that shoot out long, barbed tongues as attacks.
- **Frenzied** are similar to ensnarers, but their transformation into a true demon is more advanced, resulting in a fast and viscous creature full of energy and hunger for more souls.

#### CATEGORY 2 DEMONS

The following category 2 demons are included in this book:

- Rumored to be the initial source of the teachings of all shadows through the College of Black Ash, **remasches** are demons whose physical form is blended with the nature of the wastes where they dwell. A remasch teleports around the battlefield, inflicting chaos on their enemies directly or through the minions they control.
- Possessed of glowing eyes and tendril-ringed maws, **ruinants** breathe with a sickening wheeze and have bodies covered in inflamed scars. A ruinant can inflict fresh wounds and burns on their victims in a pattern mirroring those on the demon’s own body.
- **Torlases** are piecemeal abominations whose physical forms don’t obey the normal laws of geometry. They control the battlefield by using living flesh and whipping allies and enemies alike into advantageous position.
- **Bendraks** appear as an amalgamation of flesh and shards of a broken mirror, able to shape their bodies to distract and confuse their foes. A bendrak can divert an enemy’s attack to another enemy or hide themselves or allies behind dazzling reflections.
- **Mucerons** are the result of an ensnarer going through repeated demon evolutions to become a brutish creature, covered in several mouths that shoot out barbed tongues, pulling an enemy’s attention along with pulling them physically.
- **Chorogaunts** are terrifying demon leaders. Each is an amalgamation of several demon bodies formed into a mobile, living musical instrument. Several heads are arranged into a chorus embedded in the demon’s chest and its ribs are upturned into a fleshy pipe organ. Their attacks entrance and confuse enemies, making them more vulnerable to other demons.

### DEMON LANGUAGES

Demons speak Proto-Ctholl.

### DEMON VILLAIN POWER

At the start of any demon’s turn, you can spend VP to activate one of the following features.

- **Soulburn (3 VP):** Every demon acting this turn deals additional damage equal to their level with their abilities and free strikes.

- **Abyssal Rift (5 VP):** Two size 2 rifts to the Abyssal Wasteland appear at locations of your choosing. Each demon within 5 squares of a rift gains an edge on attacks.
  Any demon can use an abyssal rift as a portal to another abyssal rift in the encounter, moving into any space in one rift and appearing immediately in any unoccupied space in the other rift. Any non-demon creature who enters the rift for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes corruption damage equal to the level of the highest-level demon within 20 squares of a rift.
  An abyssal rift is an immovable object that has Stamina 25, weapon immunity 5, and holy weakness 5. As a maneuver, a creature who has the Magic or Psionics skill can make a hard Reason or Intuition test while adjacent to a rift to destabilize it. On a success, the rift closes. On a failure with a consequence, the rift regains 5 Stamina. If no demons are within 20 squares of the rift, it closes.

- **Abyssal Evolution (7 VP):** A demon minion of your choice turns into a non-minion demon of the same level.

## GOBLINS

As with all humanoid ancestries, different types of goblins and goblin cultures can be found across many lands, each with their own ideals. Known among themselves as **rogabrin**, meaning “more of us” in their language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoids in the world. They can be found in every environment humans occupy and in places many other humanoids avoid, including deep cave systems.

Their long arms and prehensile toes make goblins particularly well adapted to environments requiring climbing, and they live equally comfortably in treetop cities as in subterranean realms filled with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. However, just as many prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods within diverse cities. Many of those goblins who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of their society—thieves and murderers shunned by their own people.

### ENCOUNTERED IN GROUPS

Whether within a society or living in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely confident—perhaps overly so. Such groups often become bandits who ambush travelers crossing through their territory, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger bands might become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they’re encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and to flee when foes outnumber friends.

### MOBILE AND SNEAKY

Short, lithe, and long-armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins who dwell in untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These crafty skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking at their enemies’ knees, or unleash arrows as they dart from tree to tree.

### GOBLIN MAGIC

Some exiled goblins forge pacts with evil entities for magical power, including archfey, deities, and fiends. Goblin assassins conjure darkness made from the souls of their victims, while goblin cursespitters hurl magic hexes that keep their enemies at bay.

### SKITTERLING

A six-legged winged rodent the size of a housecat, a skitterling moves their clawed feet as they fly, making them appear to scurry through the air. Goblins train these pets to claw at the faces of enemies, as their feet secrete a toxin that causes temporary sluggishness.

### WAR SPIDER

Goblins ride enormous arachnids as mounts in battle. With blades attached to their legs, a war spider cuts a swath through enemy forces while archers fire from atop a platform on the beast’s back. During a raid, a spider arches their body to launch warriors off their back and into the fray.

### WARG

Some goblins form a special bond with wargs—canine creatures that many goblin communities raise as mounts, guardians, and companions.

### GOBLIN LANGUAGES

Most goblins speak Caelian and Szetch.

### GOBLIN VILLAIN POWER

At the start of any goblin’s turn, you can spend VP to activate one of the following features.

- **Goblin Mode (3 VP):** Each goblin in the encounter gains a +2 bonus to speed until the end of the round.

- **Tiny Stabs (5 VP):** Each enemy in the encounter takes 1 damage for each goblin who is adjacent to them.

- **Swamp Stink (7 VP):** The encounter map becomes covered in a green mist that lasts until the end of the round, and which can’t be dispersed by wind. All areas of the map become difficult terrain for non-goblins, and each non-goblin on the map must make a Might resistance roll.

## HUMANS

Humans flourish in every habitable part of the world, from inviting coastal cities to unforgiving mountainous terrain. While most humans live quietly in peaceful communities, some are drawn to adventure by an unquenchable thirst for excitement or power.

### VILLAINS AND HEROES

Recognizing their limited lifespan, humans often set their eyes on immortality. They unfurl empires at the tip of a sword, sacrifice lives to erect grand monuments, and even aspire to godhood, all in hopes their names will be remembered forever.
Violence and greed are close cousins in the human family. Those with power and wealth often strive for more by the sword. Others turn to theft, often driven to desperation by rapacious neighbors. Travelers in human lands are likely to encounter robbers and barons—both exact a toll.
Other humans pursue power more subtly, turning their cunning toward selfish ends. When ambitions exceed circumstances, there is always some ancient evil power to call on. Cultists seek dark desires in exchange for service, sacrificing to forbidden gods and courting apocalypse.
Fortunately, many humans devote themselves to righting wrongs and reshaping the world for the better. Heroes plunge themselves into danger time and time again, standing against natural and supernatural perils in pursuit of justice.

### RISKS AND REWARDS

Humans devote as much attention to games and gambling as to more serious pursuits. Perhaps this competitive training explains their renowned knack for seizing the moment—knowing when to risk it all on a throw of the dice. Whether in sport or battle, humans quickly spot their opponent’s mistakes and seize the advantage.
Humans see unrealized potential everywhere, whether envisioning an untamed forest transformed into a prosperous village or an ancient dungeon yielding a chest full of coins. Pursuing such ambitions might end in catastrophe, but for these gamblers, it’s a game worth playing.

### SWORDS FOR HIRE

With an appetite for warfare and gold, human adventurers are well represented in most mercenary bands. A human mercenary makes a stout ally… if you can afford their price.

### CONNECTED TO THE NATURAL WORLD

Humans are connected to the natural world in a way that other species are not. As such, they have an uncanny knack for detecting when nearby creatures, objects, and phenomena are created by magic and psionics. This same sense allows them to resist supernatural abilities and effects.

### HUMAN TRAITS

Most humans have the following trait:

- **Supernatural Insight:** A human has Magic immunity 2 and Psionic immunity 2. As a maneuver, a human can detect supernatural creatures within 5 squares of them.

### HUMAN LANGUAGES

Most humans speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.

### HUMAN VILLAIN POWER

At the start of any human’s turn, you can spend VP to activate one of the following features:

- **Alchemical Device (3 VP):** A non-minion human acting this turn can use a maneuver to throw an alchemical device.

## RADENWIGHTS

Small, agile, and hardy, radenwights have the appearance of humanoid rodents. They’re often referred to as “ratfolk,” a name they don’t particularly mind but also don’t embrace. Should anyone ask, many radenwights speak of being a ratfolk when they’re alone, but always a radenwight when part of a group. Radenwight groups proudly call themselves a “meddle,” and have a knack for appearing where others hoped they wouldn’t or whenever they are least expected. Radenwight meddles can be found in the wilderness as easily as in any city, so long as there’s suitable work and excitement to keep the members of the meddle occupied.

If radenwights’ enemies expect them to scurry away like rats, they will be painfully surprised to see the combined arrows, bodies, and blades of a meddle thrown against them all at once. Whatever radenwights do, they do it fearlessly, with deeply cherished values of bravery and fair play shining through in even the most rakish and roguish of them. Radenwights aren’t above banditry if it will support the meddle, but they greatly prefer to overwhelm, knock down, and knock out their targets rather than engage in deadly violence. They prefer weapons of precision, and look for opportunities to strike as they and their comrades create openings for one another.

### BONDS AND BRAVADO

It’s a big world out there for a bunch of small ratfolk, and radenwights learned long ago that trying to survive by running away or climbing to safety only gets you so far. Radenwights learn boldness from birth and are taught to hurl themselves fearlessly against any challenge that stands in their way. The key to this bravery is the intense bond of trust that exists between every radenwight, their comrades, and their community, and the knowledge that every other radenwight will act just as decisively as they do. In a scrap, it’s not one radenwight’s blade or arrow that brings down the foe, but the instant and instinctual follow-up from their fellows.

### THE MAGIC OF MUSIC

The pursuit of arcane studies is unusual among radenwights, though the community throws their support behind any child who happens to show that talent. Somewhat more common is the spontaneous discovery of magical aptitude through music, as the culture of radenwight meddles strongly emphasizes both music and dance. Radenwights are particularly drawn to flutes and panpipes, inspired by the legend of a flutist who enraptured an evil dragon while her meddle lined up a suitably sized boulder to be dropped from the cliff above.

### RADENWIGHT LANGUAGES

Most radenwights speak Caelian and Szetch.

### RADENWIGHT VILLAIN POWER

At the start of any radenwight’s turn, you can spend VP to activate one of the following features.

**Trouser Cut (3 VP)**
A non-minion radenwight can use the following ability.

**Trouser Cut (Action)** ◆ 2d10 + 2

- ✦ ≤11: 5 damage; push 3
- ★ 12–16: 10 damage; push 3; taunted (EoT)
- ✸ 17+: 12 damage; push 3; taunted (REA ends)
  Effect: If a target is wearing clothing covering the lower half of their body, they must use a maneuver to pull that clothing up before they can move.

**Rat Race (5 VP)**
Each radenwight shifts up to their speed. Wherever a radenwight ends this movement adjacent to at least one other radenwight, they can make a melee free strike against a target.

**Wall of Rats (7 VP)**
A 10-foot wall of living rats scurrying atop one another in a coordinated manner appears in unoccupied spaces anywhere on the encounter map and lasts until the end of the encounter. The wall doesn’t block line of effect for radenwights and their allies, but it does for other creatures, as the rats coordinate their movements with the radenwights. Each square of the wall has 10 Stamina. If the last radenwight in the encounter dies and the wall is still standing, the rats let out a hideous screech as they disperse. Each enemy on the encounter map must then make an Intuition resistance roll.

- ✸ ≤11: 10 sonic damage

## TIME RAIDERS

The kuran’zoi (coor-AN-zoy), also called time raiders, are humanoids who make the astral realm of the Sea of Stars their home. Many kuran’zoi make their living as guides for travelers from other planes, while others survive on the Sea of Stars through piracy against interplanar vessels.

### VETERANS OF THE PSYCHIC WARS

Thousands of years ago, the synlirii—a powerful species of evil psionic aberrations—created the kuran’zoi as soldiers. But as the synlirii experimented with and enhanced these warriors’ psionic potential, the kuran’zoi came to understand the true nature of their progenitors. They rebelled against the synlirii and fled to the Sea of Stars, becoming nomads of the timescape.

### HARDENED-VISION HEXAPODS

Kuran’zoi possess resilient ocular sensors that allow them to see in the dark. Knowing these sensors would also defend them against the hardlight storms of the astral realm, the escaping kuran’zoi chose the Sea of Stars as their home. They thrive where the winds of limbo roar. Time raiders also have two sets of arms, allowing them to wield melee weapons at the same time as ranged weapons. A single well-trained kuran’zoi is like a squad unto themself.

### PSI-TECH

Like their synlirii foes, time raiders travel on mindships and wield psionic weapons and tools that only their people can activate. Many kuran’zoi specialize in melee weapons that psionically devastate enemies, but time raider vertexes also learn to pilot enormous suits of psionic armor that empower their allies.

### GENRE RAIDERS

The moniker “time raider” is imprecise. Rather, when kuran’zoi raid a world of the timescape that relies on sorcery instead of kuran’zoi technology—including Orden—it seems to those worlds’ people as though the time raiders have come from the future, wielding marvelous weapons of light that hit as hard as steel.

### LEAVE A FEW ALIVE

Time raider pirates plunder the vessels they target, but allow just enough of the crew to survive so the ship can make it back home. Kuran’zoi pirate captains often remind their crews: “Leave the sheep alive. Next year, they’ll return with a new coat of wool for us to shear.”

### CREATURES OUTSIDE TIME

While in the Sea of Stars, time raiders and other creatures don’t age. As a result, many living kuran’zoi recall the Psychic Wars. They carry the lessons learned from millennia of conflict with the synlirii into new battles with devastating effect, using mindships to launch attacks on other planes and appearing exactly where they want to. However, this knowledge serves them far beyond war. Time raiders raise their young in ruined citadels and similar strongholds on obscure worlds, keeping their creches secret and protected.

### TIME RAIDER LANGUAGES

Most time raiders speak Caelian and Voll.

### TIME RAIDER VILLAIN POWER

At the start of any time raider’s turn, you can spend VP to activate one of the following features:

- **Gravity Well (3 VP):** A time raider acting this turn can activate gravity well on a square they move through while using a move action. The gravity well lasts until the end of the encounter or until a creature who can reach the well uses a maneuver to disable it. Each square within 4 squares of the gravity well is difficult terrain for non-time raiders, and any non-time raider who ends their turn in such a square is pulled 4 squares toward the well.
- **Recall Module (5 VP):** Until the end of the round, whenever a time raider ends their turn with movement remaining, they can teleport back to the space where they started their turn (or the closest unoccupied space of their choice), and make a free strike as a free triggered action.
- **Psi-Cage (7 VP):** All time raiders in the encounter create a psionic field over the encounter map, which lasts until the time raider with the highest Stamina maximum drops to Stamina 0 or chooses to end the field. While the field is up, each non-time raider on the map must make a Reason resistance roll against this psionic effect at the start of each round.

## WAR DOGS

> ### CONTENT WARNING: BRAINWASHING AND BODY HORROR
>
> War dogs are explicitly evil soldiers built from the body parts of various humans. They are created brainwashed and indoctrinated to carry out the vile orders of Ajax, a tyrant who wants to rule the world. Check in with your players before running war dogs to make sure that they’re okay with battling these brainwashed soldiers with an appearance akin to Frankenstein’s monster if he were built to be a shock troop. If anyone is uncomfortable, modify the appearance and lore of the war dogs as you see fit.

Ajax’s War Dogs—brutal patchwork soldiers—owe their new lives to the Iron Saint, and fight for him fanatically. War Dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don’t survive become material for those Body Banks.

### WAR DOG LANGUAGES

Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.

### WAR DOG VILLAIN POWER

At the start of any war dog’s turn, you can spend VP to activate one of the following features:

- **Reconstitut (3 VP):** One war dog acting this turn tears apart a nearby corpse of a humanoid and incorporates its body parts into their own. The war dog regains Stamina equal to 5 times their level.
