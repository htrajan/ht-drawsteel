**Effect:** The target revives with half their Stamina. The wight can't use this maneuver again until they attack a creature with their lifestealer longsword.

**Arise**

The first time the wight is reduced to Stamina 0 by damage that isn't fire damage or holy damage and their body isn't destroyed, they regain half their Stamina and fall prone.
