**Ferocity**

The werewolf's abilities are capable of inflicting ferocity points on non-stormwight enemies. If a creature has 10 or more ferocity at the start of their turn, they spend all their ferocity and either make a free strike at the nearest creature or shift up to their speed towards the nearest creature and take a free strike. Non-stormwight creatures that take damage in this way gain 1 ferocity. All accumulated ferocity disappears after completing a respite.

**Vukenstep**

The werewolf ignores difficult terrain.
