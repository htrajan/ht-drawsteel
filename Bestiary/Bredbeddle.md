**2d10 + 3**

- ✦ ≤11: 2 damage; A2 bleeding (save ends)
- ★ 12-16: 4 damage; A3 bleeding (save ends)
- ✸ 17+: 5 damage; A4 bleeding and dazed (save ends)

**3 Malice:** The bredbeddle shifts up to 2 squares and can target additional enemies who come within distance of this ability during the move.

#### Lop (3 Malice)

|                                        |                      |

**2d10 + 3**

- ✦ ≤11: 6 damage; bleeding (save ends) or M2 beheaded (see effect)
- ★ 12-16: 10 damage; bleeding (save ends) or M3 beheaded (see effect)
- ✸ 17+: 13 damage; bleeding (save ends) or M4 beheaded (see effect)

**Effect:** A beheaded target has their head fall into an unoccupied square adjacent to the bredbeddle, but they remain alive. While beheaded, the target is dazed and can't have line of effect to any creature other than themselves. The beheaded target can survive without their head for 24 hours, and can reattach their head by entering its square and using a maneuver to do so. A target who remains beheaded for 24 hours dies.

#### Scramble

| :------------- | :------------- |
| Keywords: --   | Type: Maneuver |
| Distance: Self | Target: Self   |

**Effect:** The bredbeddle must be headless to use this ability. The bredbeddle shifts up to their speed, and can push each creature who comes within their reach during the shift 1 square. Each square the bredbeddle leaves during the shift becomes difficult terrain.

#### Headway (5 Malice)

|                                  |                                |

**2d10 + 3**

- ✦ ≤11: 3 damage; M2 dazed (save ends)
- ★ 12-16: 5 damage; prone; M3 dazed (save ends)
- ✸ 17+: 7 damage; prone; M4 dazed (save ends)

**Effect:** The bredbeddle must have a head in their possession (attached to them or not), which they throw at the target. If the head was attached, the bredbeddle becomes headless.

#### Rebuke of the Fiendish Burlow (2 Malice)

|                 |                        |
| :-------------- | :--------------------- |
| Keywords: Magic | Type: Triggered Action |
| Distance: Self  | Target: Self           |

Trigger: A creature targets the bredbeddle with a ranged magic attack.

**Effect:** The bredbeddle uses the same ability against the triggering creature, using that creature's bonus to any power rolls they make.

#### Turn Green

|                                   |                                 |

| Keywords: Area, Magic, Resistance | Type: Villain Action 1          |

**PRS RR**

- ✦ ≤11: The target turns green and is slowed (save ends)
- ★ 12-16: The target turns green (save ends)
- ✸ 17+: No effect

**Effect:** Green shadows crawl out from under the bredbeddle's feet and attempt to turn each target green. The bredbeddle has a double edge on attacks made against targets turned green in this way.

#### Challenge

|                    |                                                                |

| Keywords: --       | Type: Villain Action 2                                         |
| Distance: Ranged 5 | Target: One creature who damaged the bredbeddle this encounter |

**Effect:** The bredbeddle points at the target and issues them a challenge. If the target refuses, they turn green (save ends). If the target accepts, the bredbeddle shifts to a space adjacent to the target, who must make a hard Might test with no additional modifiers.

#### Headlam Rampage

|                                 |                        |

**2d10 + 3**

- ✦ ≤11: 3 damage; bleeding (save ends) or M2 beheaded (see Lop)
- ★ 12-16: 4 damage; bleeding (save ends) or M3 beheaded (see Lop)
- ✸ 17+: 5 damage; bleeding (save ends) or M4 beheaded (see Lop)

**Solo Monster**

- **Solo Turns**: The bredbeddle takes two turns each round. They can use two actions on each of their turns and can take each turn after any enemy's turn. While dazed, the bredbeddle can take one action and one maneuver per turn. - **End Effect**: At the end of their turn, the bredbeddle can take 5 damage to end one save ends effect affecting them. This damage can't be reduced in any way.

**Resilient Form**

The bredbeddle can't be physically transformed in any way except by their Heady or Not trait.

**Heady or Not**

While headless, the bredbeddle can move into a space with a severed head and attach it to their neck. Doing so physically transforms the bredbeddle, who takes on the size, weight, reach, and stability of the head's original owner. These effects last until the bredbeddle is killed or beheaded, or until the head falls off after 24 hours. A head that falls off can no longer be attached to the bredbeddle.  A creature must succeed on a hard Might test made as a maneuver to rip a head off the bredbeddle. If they fail, the bredbeddle can use Executioner's Swing against them.
