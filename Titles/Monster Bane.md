# Monster Bane

“You dare mock Blunwin Mousebane? You think my deed trivial? That's because you haven't seen the size of the mouse!”

**Prerequisites:** You defeat a leader or solo monster with a Reason score of -2 or lower, such as an [[Ankheg|ankheg]].

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Beast Bane:** When a creature with the Animal keyword uses an attack against you, it has a bane on the roll.
- **[[Monster Whisperer]]:** You gain an edge on tests made to calm or tame non-sapient creatures.
- **Monster Trophy:** You decorate your equipment with a trophy from a monster. While the trophy is visible, you gain an edge on tests made to intimidate sapient creatures.
